Thus, a synthetic indicator is constructed by applying to the economic data a dynamic factorial model that allows reducing the dimensionality of the initial data. To guarantee its technical solvency, the synthetic indicator developed considers the methodological developments pointed out by Stock & Watson (1991). In this way, we proceed by applying the dynamic factorial model to the economic series. This sort of indicators constructed using dynamic common factor models aims to represent a relatively large set of initial series by means of a smaller set that achieves a simpler and more compact interpretation. These indicators must fulfill the characteristics pointed out by Burns & Mitchell (1946), Artís et al. (1997) or Cuevas & Quilis (2010, 2015). Those are the following characteristics: i.- Length of the series; ii.- Economic significance; iii.- Statistical quality; iv.- Smooth profile; v.- Speed in the availability of information, and vi.- Monthly frequency. By doing this, a simpler and more compact interpretation is got through a reduced set of common factors. The variables finally included in the indicator are: 1.- Consumption of gasoline and diesel; 2.- Exports of goods deflated by the Export Unit Value Index; 3.- Imports of goods deflated by the Import Unit Value Index; 4.- Surface of the houses to create a new plant; 5.- Registration of tourism vehicles; 6.- Production of tourism vehicles; 7.- Air transport of passengers; 8.- Maritime transport of goods (loaded and unloaded); 9.- Housing visas; 10.- Index of turnover in the industry deflated by the Industrial Price Index (IPRI); 11.- People registered in the Social Security System; 12.- Industrial Production Index deflated by the IPRI (linked series); 13.- Retail trade sales index; 14.- Travelers entering the hotels; and 15.- Index of turnover in the services sector deflated by the services Consumer Price Index (CPI). The MARSS R package is used to estimate the indicator (Holmes et al., 2014). The functions of the package estimate the parameters of the model (Z and R) by maximum likelihood using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm of Dempster et al. (1977) was used for this type of models by Shumway & Stoffer (1982) & Watson & Engle (1983). For the estimation of the factors, the Kalman filter is used once the model is represented in the state space. The results show the number of common factors that are needed to represent most of the variability of the original series. To do this, the eigenvalues of the sample autocovariance matrices are calculated. Likewise, with the objective of finding the co-integration range “s”, the Johansen test (1991) was carried out to the nine series in which there is information since 1995. This test concludes that, with a significance level of 5%, the co-integration range is 8 and, consequently, the series share a total of 1 trend in common. Then, the factorial loads are obtained in the series used, which are all positive and are used to calculate the common factor. The variable with the highest load is relative to the people registered in the Social Security System. Once the estimation of the synthetic indicator has been carried out, it is important to analyze the explanatory capacity of the indicator on quarterly GDP growth as a commonly accepted benchmark indicator. This analysis shows the existence of cyclical coherence and stability in the relationship that will allow accepting the common factor as a valid synthetic indicator. Finally, once the indicator has good properties to be a good predictor of GDP, a model is established that relating these two indicators and allows GDP to be predicted from the synthetic indicator. The results obtained allow us to monitor the monthly evolution of a regional economy in a way consistent with the quarterly evolution of GDP. In addition, the estimated synthetic estimator can be used to predict GDP through a generalized additive model (GAM) in which the correlation structure of the data is taken into account. This work has several advantages when comparing to similar proposals in previous literature. We can summarize this advantages in the following four. Firstly, it is necessary to point out the good performance of the indicator when compared with the evolution of GDP. The high degree of coupling between the evolution of both magnitudes (synthetic indicator and GDP), determined by the correlation coefficient, shows their cyclical coherence and stability. The second advantage lies in the simplicity of the procedure used. It is a simpler procedure with fewer hypothesis assumptions than in most papers with similar characteristics and, on the other hand, the empirical results are very similar. A third advantage of the calculated synthetic indicator is that it serves as an indicator of the evolution of the economy, nowadays the periodicity of GDP is quarterly, so in any quarter, two months in advance and by calculating the synthetic indicator and establishing the function of relationship between the two indicators by the proposed GAM model, it will be possible to anticipate the evolution of GDP in that quarter. Finally, the fitting of the polynomial of degree three, that is slightly worse than that made by “splines”, has the advantage that allows to give an approximation of the inflection point, in this case when IS = 1,77, which can be used as a control value in the monitoring of the conjuncture. Therefore, an easily replicable methodology is presented, both with the data available in another region or with the data available at national level. © 2020 Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia.

Cundinamarca is one of the thirteen departments that make up the Andina Region in Colombia, the position of the region, consolidates it into a strategic node through which products are mobilized that in economic terms represent about 30% of GDP national, situation that represents great possibilities to consolidate the leadership, of the region and the country in the global scene. On the other hand, agricultural products represented 12.6% of GDP in 2016 according to the DANE. According to figures from the secretary of agriculture, the department uses only 29.01% of its hectares to farm activity, with a total of 252,907 hectares. When determining the main variables that affect the productivity and competitiveness of the department, it will be possible to establish and implement tools that promote economic and social development, given the importance of the rural sector and agriculture are a priority in the region and in the country. Therefore, solutions such as better wages, internationalization processes that lead to the reduction of unemployment, increase of profits for employers and economic growth must be adopted. For this study, the SE theory of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) is used as a tool to determine if SEs affect the productivity of the sector. Without leaving aside the proposal by Romer (2006), who ensures that high wages are efficient as they increase the benefits received by firms, in proportion to production costs. This is an initial study (piloting) divided into six parts: first a documentary review is presented about the current situation of the competitive factors of the region and different theoretical aspects about the efficiency wages (SE), besides the importance of the exports as a growth factor under the Thirlwall model (2011), which has been applied to Colombia, along with a brief presentation of the FTA with the EU focused on the agricultural sector. Then, we present the methodology used, which is of a mixed type (qualitative - quantitative) supported by the model of Sahpiro and Stiglitz (1984): w = rV_u + (r + b + q) e / q Where; rVu: represents the unemployment rate A: Represents the proportion of active income per employee b: Represents the abandonment rate, q: It is the probability of finding a worker outside the workplace. e: It is the effort measured in terms of productivity. We seek to know if there are SE and how the effort measured in terms of productivity per worker affects the range of wage income received, the role in productivity and competitiveness, specifically in agricultural products. The results determine that the probability of finding SE in the sector is 28.03%, which reflects a low productivity, affecting the competitive at the regional level, according to several theorists on the subject such as Porter (1994). The variable (q), the rate of work avoidance, reduces up to 1852% the probability of finding SE as compensation for the products sown and / or harvested. Given its inverse relationship and which is applicable to reality, since once they “catch” more easily workers by avoiding their work, they will be dismissed and will hinder the productive process. For the case of the active rate of profit (r), once a percentage point decreases, the probability of finding SE decreases by 0.01395%. The effort of the worker (e) on his part helps to increase the probability of giving SE in each harvest by 0.01745%. The abandonment rate (b) generates a high probability, 19192%, that this type of salary is given, since the farmer will want to pay more or a better salary in order to encourage the worker to stay for the harvest, and This is not lost. This high rate may reflect the low level of productivity and salary level received. On the other hand, the Wald (W) test determined that the model is well adjusted, since the value of the statistic yielded by the program was greater than 5%, it was 19.16%. Consequently, the model that determines the SE in the sector under study: -18.52q-0.00013r + 0.00017 q + 191.92 b = ŵ From the above it is concluded that the Cundinamarca region has great potential in terms of agricultural products, but it is considered that the productivity of the sector is low. One reason is the low income of people who work and depend on agricultural activities, which affects their quality of life because they can’t access good nutrition, quality education, among others, decreasing their productive capacity. This is consistent with sociological SE models such as that proposed by Akerlof (1982). In addition, there is a need to close the gaps between living and wage conditions between the rural and urban sectors in order to retain rural skilled labor, which leads to achieving a competitive and sustainable sector that has the capacity to face the challenges that come with the internationalization processes and thus take advantage of the opportunities offered by FTA such as the one in force with the EU. It is recommended to work directly with the actors linked to the sector, which will allow knowing their perception about the level of wages received, compared to the level of welfare, in order to suggest strategies aimed at formulating public policies that contribute to improving the productive level, competitiveness, exports and social welfare in Cundinamarca. It will be possible to reduce the abandonment rate, improve and encourage technological and social innovation and generate research, which will be reflected in regional sustainability. The proposed model determines that there are no efficiency wages for the agricultural sector in Cundinamarca, which affects the levels of productivity and therefore competitiveness and does not allow to take advantage of the existing trade agreement with the EU, which offers opportunities as developed in this research, and despite the great potential of the region. Therefore, it is recommended to carry out this study for each type of crop, with the purpose of establishing in a specific way wages should be rethought and their impact on productivity and competitiveness, all accompanied by policies to mitigate unemployment generated through the strengthening of other sectors such as tourism. From this study, it could be concluded that it is necessary to establish a minimum wage for the rural sector of Cundinamarca, since this generates a certain degree of job security. The sociological model proposed by Akerlof (1982) should also be considered, in order to create a sense of belonging and other attitudes that motivate workers to increase their effort as gratitude towards the farmer, increasing their productivity and lowering supervision costs. Consistent with the need to level the rural wage, which according to official reports represents a proportion close to 70% of the minimum urban wage, should be articulated with the policies proposed by the Secretary of Competitiveness and Development of Cundinamarca, because it would not be logical to increase wages, if you do not have the conditions to reach markets like the EU, to obtain the necessary income to be able to pay them. In summary, given the results of the model, the ideal would be to increase wages to the point where the probability of SE occurring is high, helping to improve competitiveness levels, without generating high unemployment and allowing internationalization processes to be tackled., which at the same time can become the main tool to combat the negative effect of this type of wages. This will have positive consequences both for the local society and for the national and international ones from the alimentary point of view, since the problematic around the scarcity of food and level of poverty can’t be left aside, advancing in the fulfillment of the objectives of sustainable development. © 2021 Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia.

Similarly, hydrological region 23 coast of Chiapas, has an economy governed by tertiary sector activities and is comprised of the Istmo-Costa and Soconusco socioeconomic regions, the latter is the main region that contributes to the gross domestic product of the state of Chiapas. It should be noted that this socioeconomic growth has required a greater demand for water resources, which has led to water pollution. The deterioration of the area's water resources is caused by the discharge of wastewater, solid waste and agrochemicals into natural waterways. In order to assess the state of the water resources of hydrological regions 21 and 23, 31 sampling sites were established in the spring of 2021 distributed in the main streams. Each sample was analyzed for chemical properties: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major anions and cations (CO32-, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+), total dissolved solids (TDS), percentage of sodium (%Na), adsorption ratio of sodium (RAS), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), as well as a hydrochemical evaluation. The waters of the hydrological regions 21 and 23 present as dominant facies the calcium-magnesium bicarbonate, whose possible origin is a consequence of the dilution process of the geological material (water-rock interaction) with low and medium concentrations. With respect to salinity, 45.16% are low salinity waters and 93.55% of the sites have low sodium, therefore, they are considered recommended for irrigation with moderate restrictions. © 2023 Authors.

HMA communities vary in composition and life histories and are affected by land use and management. The caldén forests (Prosopis caldenia Burkart) in the province of San Luis have suffered a considerable reduction in their area. Currently, its relics are part of a landscape made up of forests and lands cultivated with Medicago sativa L. (alfalfa) and Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees (weeping lovegrass), key forage species for livestock production in the region. Considering the ecological and economic importance that these land uses have for the region, the objective of this work was to analyze whether the diversity of AMF is affected by the change in land use from caldén forest to alfalfa or weeping lovegrass plots and whether there are indicator species for each use. Four plots of permanent forest were established, 4 of alfalfa and 4 of weeping lovegrass. Soil samples were taken from each plot, the physicochemical characteristics were determined and the AMF spores were extracted. The composition of the spore communities was different in each land use. The AMF morphospecies richness did not showed differences between forest and alfalfa but show differences with weeping lovegrass. Total abundance, spore abundance of ruderal and stress-tolerant species were significantly higher in alfalfa. In addition, 2 indicator species were identified in alfalfa, 1 in forests, and 2 in weeping love grass. This study provides evidence suggesting that land-use change in Caldenal significantly alters the composition of AMF spore communities and may have a negative effect on this endemic forest. © 2023, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

The chicozapote, is native to Central America, has economic potential, due to the properties of its fruits, wood, and the production of latex. Objective. To evaluate the incidence and severity of Chaetocapnodium zapotae in Manilkara zapota fruits. Methodology. In the month of April 2022, the incidence and severity of Chaetocapnodium zapotae were evaluated in an orchard in the Apazapan, Veracruz, Mexico area. Trees were randomly selected (25% of the total number of trees in the orchard). 20 fruits per tree were collected. The percentage of incidence was calculated with the formula: I (%)=number of fruits with signs of disease / total number of fruits evaluated *100: Severity was evaluated with a visual scale. Results. The percentage of fruits with the presence of C. zapotae was not significantly different between the two strata of the tree crowns (t=0.519, gl=22, p=0.609). Also, no differences were observed in the orientation of the fruits within the crown. (t=1.59, gl=22; p= 0.126). All the trees evaluated presented at least one affected fruit, with an average percentage of incidence of 39.6 ± 4.5% (mean ± standard error). Implications. With this study, the need to look for new alternatives for the commercialization of its fruits is evidenced, such as the sale of processed pulp and thus avoiding its depreciation due to the external appearance.

The central thesis maintains that the presence of new non-state actors, with ownership of the land and ecosystems, and with philosophical orientations of deep ecology, generates new conditions for environmental conservation and redefines the position of traditional inhabitants, producers linked to family farming. It is critically posited that the new valuation languages operate as a political expression of power and authority, which severely impacts the possibility of reproduction of domestic units, which need ample feeding spaces for their livestock and the native forest for protection. In this way, the traditional space of daily life loses regularity due to the creation of private parks, since they have non-productive purposes and incorporate post-humanist values. Likewise, through ethnographic records, a gradual process of territorial denationalization, absence of local sovereignty and difficulties for the reproduction of the rural culture of Patagonia is verified, which make it difficult to imagine the future by the productive units. © 2021 Universidade Federal do Parana.

The analysis of 298 barracks reveals that their typology evolved, in three different periods, due to advances in construction solutions, regulations and the changing idea of the barracks, but with a constant precariousness. This reality, together with the lack of knowledge and associated prejudices, is currently causing many barracks to be demolished, with a significant loss of heritage.

After the mineral extraction process, layers of collected soils and sterile material are usually used to form artificial soils, also called mining soils; these, due to their edaphic conditions, possess a certain toxicity and infertility degree, which restricts the growth and survival of organismsintheenvironment,leadingtotheformation of desert areas. Mining soil rehabilitation encourages the restoration of adequate conditions, allowing it to once more, offer some environmental goods and services. In this study, the objective was to evaluate the biochar, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and NPK effect on the rehabilitation of mining soils, and on Guazuma ulmifolia seedling growth which were evaluated from three trials: initially a germination trial was carried out, using Guazuma ulmifolia seeds, mining soils and biochar in concentrations of 0, 1, 5 and 10%; Then, a nursery scale trial was established where four treatments containing the seedling, biochar, AMF and NPK were applied. Later, a field scale trial was carried out using four treatments with the seedling, biochar and AMF. Results show that biochar in concentrations of 1 and 5% significantly increased the germination percentage, leaf length and plant biomass; in addition, a 60% infection rate was found in plant roots by AMF; likewise, there was a significant increase in pH, phosphorus, organic carbon, glomalin and enzymatic activity in soils, also as well as a significant reduction in electrical conductivity. The use of biochar and mycorrhizae improved the properties of the soils and stimulated growth in the seedling, thus promoting the rehabilitation process. © 2021 Mexican Society of Soil Science.

Due that, peasants or small farmers see themselves forced to abandon the cultivation of basic grains and seek other strategies. They opted by the diversification of agricultural production, gambling by those crops with higher productivity and profitability. In this sense, the objective of this study was to make known the banana production process, which is the main crop that small agricultural producers have in the municipality of Cane, in La Paz, Honduras, as well as to identify and describe other aspects related to production. The results of the study demonstrated that: (1) small farmers have diversified agricultural production; (2) bananas have replaced the cultivation of basic grains as the main agricultural economic activity, and (3) in the production process, they have incorporated new techniques and technologies, as well as a variety of production inputs, in order to rise crop productivity and profitability. From the analysis of these results, it is concluded that Cane is developing a new agriculture with different characteristics from those of previous epochs. © 2021 Revista Iberoamericana de Viticultura Agroindustria y Ruralidad.

Over time, human activity began to threaten the environment, affecting the damage to the different ecosystems that comprise it. Given the marked importance that the countries of the world give to the care and preservation of the environment, research is needed that seeks alternatives to prevent, preserve, conserve, mitigate or reduce environmental damage caused by human activity. In order to systematize the theoretical foundations about land use planning based on environmental damage due to economic activities in mountain ecosystems, this work is carried out. In order to comply with it, generalities about the management plans are addressed, from the international to the Cuban framework. There is also a tour of the Special Mountain Plans and how they address the issue of environmental damage due to economic activities in these ecosystems. In turn, economic activities carried out in ecosystems and how they influence the environment are analyzed.

Deforestation is driven by urban population growth, agriculture, gold-mining, infrastructure development, and the lack of urban and territorial planning. Forest loss has many negative social consequences, such as immigration and persistent poverty. The study analyzes the conservation value of a pristine high terrace forest, located in the southeast of the Peruvian Amazon. This area supports the pressure of threats of deforestation and increased land invasion since the conditioning of the road corridor built by the Initiative for the Integration of the South American Regional Infrastructure (IIRSA). For this, the contingent valuation method (CVN) was proposed through the dichotomous logit model to define the willingness to pay (WTP) of the respondents on proposed prices of a hypothetical scenario conserve the forest as a strategy to strengthen their capacities in the education of professionals, the population, and the investigation like a driver in the generation of the knowledge. The result shows that the average WTP to implement the conservation program was S/ 17.49 (USD 5.16) as a single payment per year. This value presents a highly significant relationship with the variables: education, the importance of the existence of the forest, environmental knowledge, and income, in the econometric model to accept the proposal. Finally, the forest is important in itself for the population, and they show a positive disposition for its conservation. © 2020 Los Autores. Editado por la AEET.

Pig farms are an important economic activity in the state of Yucatán, but they cause great environmental damage, such as groundwater contamination, air pollution, and soil degradation, which together affect both health and economy of local populations. Objective: The aim of this work was to spatially identify the surface suitable for the establishment of pig farms in the state of Yucatán where damage to the environment and human health are not a serious problem. Methodology: For the elaboration of the cartographic model, four maps were used as inputs that represent the evaluation variables, they are: altitude, karst depressions, soils and duration of the rainy season. They were converted to raster formats and handled in a geographic information system. Five classes of territorial aptitude for the establishment of pig farms were defined, 1 = very low; 2 = low; 3 = mean; 4 = discharge; and 5 = very high. The index and superposition method were used to integrate the four variables in a territorial aptitude model. To assign weights to each variable, a multi-criteria decision technique called ""analytical hierarchies’ method"" was used. Results: The surface area of the territory of the state of Yucatán according to the suitability classes for the establishment of pig farms was: a very low with 21%; low with 50%; medium with 15%; high with 6%; and the very high zone with 8%. The areas of high and very high suitability for the establishment of pig farms are located in the south of the state. Implications: the map of the suitability for the establishment of pig farms on a regional scale will be an important input for updating the ""program of ecological land management"" of the state of Yucatan. However, due to the particularities of the karst, it is very necessary to carry the analysis to scales greater than 1:50 000 for the development of specific pig projects. Conclusions: The land evaluation model for the establishment of pig farms in the state of Yucatán on a regional scale, allows spatially identifying suitable and highly suitable areas for such activity. The most suitable territories are located in the south of the state, so it would be recommended that the growth of pig farming be those territories after consulting with the native populations. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

In this work, the capacity of the ecological infrastructure (EI) of the city of Mar del Plata (Buenos Aires province, Argentina) to provide fourteen types of urban ecosystem services (UES) was analyzed. To collect the existing knowledge on the subject, an approach based on obtaining local expert knowledge mediated by the Delphi technique was used. The work dynamics consisted of two rounds of anonymous online surveys and an open synchronous workshop in which the previously obtained results were discussed. Twenty-nine local experts from different disciplines were consulted, and they were divided into two groups that worked simultaneously. The results showed the relationships between the EI components and their ability to provide regulation cultural and regulation and maintenance UES. Based on the workshop carried out with local experts it was possible to investigate some properties of the EI that could intervene in the capacity to provide said UES. The local interdisciplinary knowledge framework developed in this work represents a useful source of information in the current debate that is taking place in the city regarding the planning of sustainable urban contexts.

The objective of this work was to develop a methodological proposal for the identification of Payment Mechanisms for Water Ecosystem Services (MERESE-H) in the department of Madre de Dios, Peru. Workshops were held with key local actors to identify current human activities that cause changes in land use in the study area. Additionally, a diagnostic study was developed at the socioeconomic level to learn about the situation of the sanitation service of water operators in rural areas and small cities in the Amazon region of Madre de Dios. As a methodological sequence, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) tool was used to calculate the Hydrological Service Index (HSI) for the prioritized basins, showing the current status of their water services. These dates were used to contrast the problem of administration of operation and the maintenance of the service together with the projected deficiencies of the ISH of the basins under study; resulting in a serious deficiency in the service at the level of quality and quantity of water for its adequate use as a basic service. Finally, with the proposed methodology, five sites have been identified that meet the criteria for an adequate design, implementation, and management of a MERESE-H. This result is visualized in a ""traffic light"" table for intervention in the short and medium term in rural areas and small Amazonian cities. The InVEST tool, as part of the valuation process, is recommended for the evaluation of the hydrological services of the micro-basins to work; but to obtain results closer to reality, it is necessary to have updated data, mainly on land use and weather (precipitation and evapotranspiration). © Departamento Académico de Biología, Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina, Lima – Perú.","Amazonia; ecosystem services; hydrological service index; InVEST; MERESE-H","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193704817"

In this context, the aim of this paper is to estimate social preferences for the aesthetic quality of the agricultural landscape and to determine the relative importance of its component attributes. For this purpose, the flowering of Cieza (Murcia) is used as a case study, integrated in a landscape that is highly representative of semi-arid Mediterranean agroecosystems. Using the choice experiments technique, the perceived usefulness and relative importance of the different landscape attributes were obtained. The results showed people’s preferences for landscapes with a high presence of fruit trees, natural vegetation and traditional water features and with an absence of buildings and asphalt roads.

The attributes of the index with the greatest affectations were the natural regeneration, the composition and structure of the riparian vegetation. The BMWP_CR water quality index showed that water quality decreased in the rainy season. A total of 17 676 macroinvertebrate individuals were counted, belonging to 13 orders and 50 families. Baetidae was the family with the largest number of collected individuals, followed by Hydropsychidae and Elmidae. The richness and diversity (H’) values were higher in the dry season.

Objective: This research evaluated factors that influence the silvopastoral technology adoption in Chiapas, Mexico. Methodology: Used an integrative methodology relates variables institutional performance, knowledge, and perception of producers on livestock system and interaction between actors. The above was linked to a physical context with satellite imagines analysis to identify components adopted in the field. Results: It was found that the type of producer, the location of the property, and the form of institutional support limit the adoption of herd management and feed production intensification technologies such as protein banks and forage banks. Implications: This methodology helped identify the limiting factors for adoption, understand the project process, and identify strategies towards sustainable practices. Conclusion: The low adoption of technologies is determined by the decision-making of producers on factors such as pest and disease control, climatic, economic and access to machinery and equipment that are influenced by the social synergies that can be built with technicians and with other producers. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

Case overview/synopsis: On 19th April 2019, Mr Kai, an analyst tracking real estate firms was excited to present to his team a new robust technique of firm valuation suitable for real estate companies, namely, the CCF technique and was also keen to deliberate on its application. Though the investment scope using this technique could be located in Godrej properties (GP), a reputed brand and the largest listed real estate developer by sales in 2018, yet, he was concerned about the assumptions of growth of real estate industry in India, in general, and the GP in particular. Importantly, this was because the real estate market in India was undergoing many structural changes. For instance, the buyers’ preferences were changing and unsold inventory in the industry was at its peak. Under these market conditions, an announcement was made by GP about a target return on equity of 20% in 2018–2023 expecting a dominant place in the real estate market in India, which also carried the threat of jeopardizing the reputation of GP, if under any circumstance the target was not accomplished.

The information collected under the denomination of professional occupation would be used early on to describe the transformation of a space (Lebergott, 1966; Lewis, 1979). On the threshold of the 21st century, the studies of Rosenbloom (1996) and Broadberry and Wagner (1996) are well known, and their contributions were along similar lines. In any case, we will take as a reference the theoretical foundations of Walter Isard (1956, 1973), although, the dynamic localization economies known as “MAR externalities” are nourished by the contributions of Marshall (1890), Arrow (1962) and Romer (1986), as specified by Fracasso & Vitucci (2018, p. 120). At the regional level, and for large aggregates, population censuses and industrial and trade contribution statistics are the two informative sources par excellence (Parejo, 2005, p. 11). Moreover, the structure of employment will serve even better than other variables, such as aggregate production or foreign trade figures, to reveal the process of economic change (Pérez Moreda, 1984, p. 26). The treatment of data referring to professional occupations in censuses represents a basis on which to structure a study methodology, which was already used to understand the change that took place in England during the Industrial Revolution (Harley, 1993). The present research provides a methodological proposal based precisely on population censuses, taking the activities that serve to elaborate certain instruments of Regional Economics, such as sectoral participations, markets-shares and location quotients. The aim is to recognize the structure of employment in Andalusia, identifying the typology of the activity as a guide to its development model, within the framework of the second technological revolution, a well-defined stage in economic history, starting in the early twentieth century and culminating in the sixties, when developmentalism arrived and the economic indicators reveal the process of convergence with other advanced European countries. The research has required a previous homogenization process (Ruiz Romero de la Cruz, 2001), carried out taking into account the philosophy that inspires the definitions provided in each of the censuses. A second step has been taken, elaborating the sectorial participations, which indicate the number of employees in the different activities, taking as a reference the total employed population, observing the distribution of the labor force, in the different sectors and provinces in the chosen time cut-off. The market-share indicator and the location quotients will be other instruments that will reflect the spatial characteristics of the Spanish industrialization process. The formal structure is a quotient whose numerator relates the population employed in the subsector to be analyzed to the total population employed in the subsector indicated for the country as a whole. The denominator would be formed by a new quotient, which marks the relation between the employed population in the sector considered at the provincial level and the total employed population in the national set (Isard, 1973). We point out two issues that will help to interpret the data. First, it should be noted that the resulting figure in the numerator will reflect the “market-share” or market-share of the province in the national total for the sector or subsector under study. On the other hand, the objective of the location quotient (LQ) as a whole is to observe the relative specialization of an area with respect to the nation as a whole; therefore, we are talking about the concentration of activity. If the values obtained exceed the unit CL>1, it means that in that territorial unit the activity exceeds the national average, while if CL<1 it means that the activity is lower than the national average in the given sector. The results have made it possible to identify long-term trends and to qualify some of the conclusions of other researchers. We have not attempted to enter into the various debates that analyze the trajectory of change in Andalusia’s economic sectors over such a broad, diverse and complex period of time, so we will refer to the most important and decisive issues in explaining the transformation process in Andalusia. The history of Andalusian modernization is inevitably subject to the geographical reality of its territory, its size, the dispersion of population centers, the difficulty of articulating it through infrastructures or the unequal location of natural resources. This elements turned out to be determining factors for its development, being possible to consider the characterization of Marshallian industrial districts (Martín Rodríguez, 1990), depending on the more or less restrictive application of the use of the concept, as Castillo Alonso, (1994, p. 54) affirms. In general terms, it is the weakness of demand and the scarce capacity for saving, investment and expenditure, which conditioned the development of Andalusia. The notion of extractive capitalism explains an economic model, based on the empowerment of certain low-yield sectors, with a poorly paid workforce, within the framework of an industry with a low technological level and with investments that do not have the due profitability, whose product also leaves the land (Arenas, 2016). The research carried out, shows that there was a transformation that is visualized through the occupation in certain basic sectors, without reaching high levels of progress, except at specific moments in time and in certain activities, which respond to that defined structure of economic model, where the capital did not forge a diversified and sustained progress, in the sectors that could have been a driving force, earlier in time, for the whole of Andalusia. The methodology applied has shown in numerous activities the division of Andalusia into two economic zones, with the eastern part experiencing a more parsimonious modernization process, a conclusion that, although with nuances, was already pointed out by Parejo (2011, p. 153), for the stage prior to the economic boom of the seventies. Thus, Cadiz and Seville, which will be joined by Malaga, have more dynamic patterns of economic transformation, although a certain decline in Cadiz can be observed at certain points in time. It is important to mention the economic axis that revolves around Seville and its province, whose historical role as Andalusian capital has predisposed it to act as an economically attractive focus, allowing a diversification of its activities, experiencing a more accelerated process of outsourcing than the rest of the provinces. In any case, we believe that the instruments of Regional Economics can be used to analyze the processes of change, based on the professional data provided by the censuses, in our case in Andalusia. A methodological proposal that has given visibility to another path, scarcely used in economic history, for the study of the transformation of a territory, especially in stages where statistics do not have accurate data or are simply nonexistent, as in the decades preceding the economic development and the end of the dictatorship in Spain in the twentieth century. © 2024 Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia.

However, it has been threatening by a serious problem of forest loss. The main environmental threats are due to mismanagement of the territory that causes the concentration of land, agricultural expansion, livestock, gold mining, and uncontrolled economic exploitation. This study analyzes the dynamics of forest loss and changes in land use and cover between 1999-2018. Remote sensing techniques were used to quantify forest loss. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and 8 Operational Land Imagery (OLI). The images were processed using a supervised classification called Neural Net. The methodology includes validation procedures using field verification points and medium and high-resolution remote sensing images of different sensors (SPOT-5, PlanetScope, WorldView, and Drone). The results showed a forest loss of 1698.63 km2 during 1999-2018, with an annual deforestation rate of -0.21%, and an average forest loss of 59.28 km2/year. For changes from forests to other land use, we found the conversion of 841.41 km2 during 2014-2018. Our results indicate that agriculture is the most responsible for advancing deforestation (72.90%), while gold mining has a greater incidence in targeted sectors. © 2021 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre.

Semi-structured interviews were used to obtain information from 24 ejidos (communal land), and economic and productive information from two Representative Production Units-both individual and collective-was collected using the technique of panels of ejidatarios. The results indicate that 79% of the ejidos produce collectively, thanks to a designed scheme that, in turn, is operated by ejidatarios ranchers. When analyzing collective cattle raising, the key variables with statistical differences p<0.1 corresponded to the percentage of common use land with respect to the total ejido together with the average number of common use hectares per ejidatario (communal land); contrary to the size of the ejido, the number of ejidatarios (owners) as well as the number of paddocks. The high dependence on common use resources as a livelihood for cattle ranchers refers to the main incentive to manage the pastures collectively, which is reflected in higher productivity and income. This is a consequence of the restricted access to common use, the economies of scale generated and the division of labor.

The social reproduction of indigenous migrants is adjusted to the receiving territory based on the work for the management of biocultural diversity. This study corresponds to the territorial unit ""La Joya"", in Ayala, Morelos, configured by indigenous people from the state of Guerrero. Objective. Explain the sustainability traits of family production systems (FPS) established by immigrants to Morelos in the last 20 years. Methodology. The sampling was 12.5% of the FPS, the difficulties of the languages and disposition of the informants were dissipated with ethnobiological techniques such as guided tours and semi-structured interviews, because they allowed to investigate the management of plants and animals, costs of labor work, use value and exchange value, the structure of the plants used, the number of eggs and laying cycle per year for the birds, and the destination of production, with this information an annual availability calendar of goods. The structure and ecological composition were obtained by sampling the total surface of 10 FPS. The attributes calculated were: species richness and abundances. The coverage of the plants, the house and the animal pens were located in Cartesian plans. With items from both approaches, the annual economic valuation of the management and of the production of each FPS was obtained, both integrated the environmental economic valuation. Results. Include eight management activities; the values of use of biocultural diversity were 11, the food with 47 species stands out. The composition is 96 plant species and 13 animals that provide goods for self-supply and sale throughout the year. Its economic valuation, including the family work that allows the conservation of FPS the reaches between one and 30 times the minimum salary. Implications. The social group studied comes from an área whit vegetation and a climate similar to the one that they immigrated to, which facilitates its biocultural reproduction in small lands, whose structure and composition of plants and animals is similar to that reported for communities originating from Morelos, both with sustainability indicators. Conclusion. The sustainability of the FPS is the result of social work aimed at the traditional management of biological diversity, which allows the sustained production of goods with use values for self-supply and exchange values that enter monetary resources, whose sum It shows the environmental economic efficiency, the environmental economic efficiency, the contribution to the survival and social reproduction of indigenous migrants. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

Its argument is that the remarkable difference in the performance between both regions is mainly explained by the ability of these Asian countries to pursue a synergetic development strategy, whereas the Latin American countries failed to do so. The extent, scope, and timing of a redistributive land reform were key ingredients of such a strategy, as well as the linkages established between the economic sectors. It is concluded that a synergistic development strategy offers the best chances of promoting a more dynamic, sustainable, and equitable development process for Latin America. © 2023 Fondo de Cultura Economica.

The text describes and analyzes how the dynamics of demographic frontier expansion, through highland-origin settler farmers, exerted intense pressure on natural resources, subsequent environmental degradation, and eventually regional demographic saturation. The migrant settlers continually reproduced their family units of production and consumption in frontier territories, thereby creating new natures and destroying others in the process. In this context, we aim to explore the links between demographic growth in the Alto Huallaga and the slash-and-burn agricultural systems that accompanied them, as well as the socio-environmental consequences and the ongoing feedback dynamics between these processes. In doing so, we put to the test the model of land use extensification and intensification proposed by economist Ester Boserup. © 2023, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

This definition is based on: (i) the extent of forest resources; (ii) forest biological diversity; (iii) the health and vitality of forests; (iv) productive functions; (v) protective functions; (vi) socio-economic functions; and (vii) the regulatory, institutional, and policy framework. Based on the review of available information on these aspects, the current situation of deforestation is illustrated, which reduces forest coverage and diminishes the provision of ecosystem services. Risks of unsustainability in the utilization of certain resources, such as species listed in the CITES Convention, are identified. Inappropriate situations regarding limited access to resources for certain stakeholders are highlighted, as well as delays in the implementation of certain instruments that would help solve key issues for rural producers, such as land-use agreements (leasing) for agroforestry systems. A review of the legal framework and governance structure developed is conducted, which presents distinctive positive features such as the equal representation of indigenous peoples, the state, and the non-public sector in the Board of Directors, and the existence of significant participation spaces like the Forest and Wildlife Management Committees (CGFFS), which have not been established. The discussion briefly addresses whether the identified current limitations are a result of a legal and organizational design issue or rather a management problem, in order to guide necessary interventions for improving management outcomes. © 2023, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

Furthermore, challenges for the conservation of peri-urban forests are discussed based on key territorial dynamics and existing mechanisms for territorial planning and management. It is identified that the greater pressure from urban growth on peri-urban forests is mainly linked to migratory processes and regional economic dynamics related to mining and tourism activities. Likewise, the trend towards reduced population and housing density in new expansion areas, along with an increase in the real estate supply for secondary residences, poses a threat to sustainability.

The objective is to find out the viability to reinstate in the market this traditional landrace bean through an analysis of its acceptance by consumers. Specifically, the intention of consumers to buy different types of dry beans (‘Muniesa’ beans, among others) is analysed, considering their external appearance and associated information (place of production and representative characteris-tics), as well as the type of package. To do that, a qualitative study was carried out using a focus group conducted with three dry beans consumers groups in two geographical areas close to the production area. Results indicated that the ‘Muniesa’ traditional white bean will be accepted by a segment of consumers who usually consume dry beans because of their intrinsic characteristics (size, colour or shape) and their place of production and, in particular, because it is a traditional crop with specific agrono-mic characteristics that it is produced in non-irrigated land with little water requirements. © 2023, Asociacion Interprofesional para el Desarrollo Agrario.

The methodology that has been followed to build the article is as follows: first, the bibliography about the area have been revised; second, it has begun for almost two years a comprehensive, careful and systematic search on historical documentary sources. Forty documents have been found: thirty of the Notarial Protocols (Provincial Historical Archive of Murcia) and the rest of the Chapter Acts of the Cieza Town Hall during the period of the Modern Age; the data have been organized in a classification according to the centuries; afterwards, the evaluation and analysis of each sample has been carried out, reviewing them in a critical way and comparing them; and, finally, the construction of the study and the bibliographical search have been carried out at the same time, with the aim of enriching and contrasting the work. The results are as follows: 1) Types of government administration. 1.1) The first is centred on a period of the 16th and 17th centuries, when the irrigation community granted the directional authority of the whole canalisation system to individuals from outside the entity. These individuals had a similar profile: they belonged to the local elite of Cieza. The profitability of this contract was extracted in the zero confrontation between the farmers, since they all started with the same rules, limitations and fine. Therefore, it guaranteed the survival and collective welfare. The disadvantage was based on the capacity to act and the initiatives (regulations, restoration of all irrigation system) with the subject that had agreed the commitment. 1.2) The interference of the council at the end of the 17th century until 1800. The powers were shared between the two institution. The council initially acted to solve the internal problems of the irrigation community. An example is the appointment of acquirers. These also had three stages: Elected by the community’s representative (1543-1663), by the irrigation community itself (1676-1743) and by the municipal council (1744-1800). The council also acted as a financial support body. 2) Types of irrigation distribution: one is by type of plantation depending on its harvesting characteristics (1543); another is irrigation organised by site, from the head of the ditch to the tail of the ditch, which was certainly a common practice at the time (1610); and finally, the free flow due to the high amount of water that the ditch carried. This last model was experimented with thanks to the new installation of the weir in the middle of the 18th century. 3) The canalisation system didn´t cover the entire irrigation basin. Its extension upstream in the 18th century is close to the theories of the archaeologist Miquel Barcelo. The traditional canalisation systems of an Islamic nature (azud, acequia) have been conceived and designed by such a civilisation in the Mediterranean area from the beginning for their eventual propagation and growth, especially in its upper zone. 4) The irrigation community itself obtained economic gains through the annual rate of the farmers and through the leases on its farms, by converting them into land for livestock grazing. It offers a functional strategy of double capital extraction. It should be added the power to invest in structures with social purposes and services, such as the construction of wooden boats to facilitate the passage of landowners from one side of the Segura to the other. Conclusions: The study has been satisfactorily evaluated. First class information has been extracted about the Andelma Irrigation Community. This is an irrigation entity which underwent different processes of change and adaptation during the Modern Age both in its administrative policy, irrigation distribution and its own hydraulic system. An individual example of evolution, of adaptation of the South East of Spain that has shaped a unique type of agricultural landscape. © 2020 Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia.

The PES have been implemented, for the most part, in rural contexts, and their extension to urban contexts requires adjustments in the design of the traditional scheme. On that need, there are not enough advances reported in the literature. To design a PES in urban areas (PSAU), we pretend to understand the heterogeneity that characterizes the landholders and their properties, where the ecosystem provider of the ES is located. This article presents a grouping exercise of 111 selected properties to be part of a PSAU in Colombia, in order to identify similar characteristics between the groups, which facilitate the design of payment strategies. The grouping was done considering specific variables of the urban context and with the k-prototypes cluster analysis algorithm, resulting in the division of the properties into three groups. We found that two of the three groups have more differentiating characteristics: the first is mostly private, with smaller and more expensive total areas; while the other is mainly public, with a larger total area and at a lower cost. We concluded that the payment to be recognized for the first group should be very attractive if you want to have a good adoption, since the opportunity cost represented by the availability and value of the land is higher. The other group could be the one that adopts more easily because it has a larger area and a lower economic value, because of in this group the properties are mainly public domain, social appropriation actions with the community are fundamental. The clustering method turned out to be an adequate process to address the heterogeneity present in the urban context. © 2023 Universidade Federal do Parana.

This study documents the trade of wild medicinal plants in the district of Lircay, in the southern region of Peru. Additionally, the composition of the wild medicinal species registered in the study is compared with the richness of wild species reported in three markets in the region. Methods: The methodology was based on interviews with 70 vendors between 2015 and 2018. To compare the richness of species between markets, the data was conditioned in a matrix of presence and absence with which the Jaccard similarity index was calculated. Results and Discussion: Seventy-two wild medicinal plants were commercialized for 14 subcategories of medicinal use. The most frequently sold species were Clinopodium brevicalyx, Peperomia galioides and Minthostachys andina. It was also observed that the trade may be influencing the conservation status of Haplorhus peruviana and Ephedra rupestris, both taxa categorized as Critically Endangered according to Peruvian legislation. The problem of species replacement between Equisetum bogotense, Ephedra rupestris and Baccharis genistelloides, which are marketed under the name of ""horsetail"", is reported. Similarly, Perezia pinnatifida is sold under the common name of ""valeriana"" and is attributed the properties for the genus Valeriana. Those last observations suggest that an adequate taxonomic identification of the plants sold in public markets is necessary, specially, because of the antagonistic effects that could have different active ingredient of those species. Finally, when comparing the plants sold in Lircay with three other Andean markets (Ancash, Ayacucho and Huancavelica), a low similarity was found, which suggests a high variability of the commercialized plants and the need of more studies to know the total amount of species used for medicinal purposes in this region. Conclusions: The similarity of wild medicinal plants between the Andean markets of Cajamarca, Ancash, Ayacucho and Huancavelica is low. © 2021, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

In this sense, the fundamental lines of the construction of the proprietary system that consolidates liberal modernity are investigated, as a force that reacts to medieval conceptions about the appropriation and use of goods. This route of ideas is drawn upon the map of the evolution of capitalism as a form of social and economic organization, which responds to political and ideological forces that explain the persistence of private property as the only way of relating people and goods.

This has led to farmers transitioning from crop agriculture toward mixed production or specializing in cattle raising. Characterizing livestock systems using a multidimensional perspective allows for identifying strategies for increasing their sustainability. Objective: To classify and characterize family cattle farming systems (FCFS) of the Frailesca region of Chiapas, Mexico taking into account the contribution of cattle raising to family income, and using a multidimensional perspective. Methodology: Eighty family units in two areas of the Frailesca region - valley (40) and highlands (40) - were evaluated. Information was obtained through application of questionnaires to farmers. According to the percentage of contribution of cattle raising to family income, a K-means clustering analysis was carried out in each area to differentiate FCFS. Average values of technical, economic, environmental, and social indicators were compared among systems using ANOVA or Kruskall Wallis tests. Results: Two FCFS were identified in each of two areas of the Frailesca region: (I) mixed family systems (MFS) and (II) family systems specialized in cattle raising (FSSC). Average percentages of contribution of cattle raising to family income were: (1) valley MFS = 32.5%; (2) valley FSSC = 80.5%; (3) highland MFS = 38.5%; and (4) highland FSSC = 71.7%. The valley FSSC followed an intensive-technified cattle raising with high use of external inputs and had the highest values of the economic indicators: calves produced per ha, milk production per cow, and net margin per hectare. The valley MFS practiced semi-intensive-technified cattle raising with low use of external inputs which led it had lower economic profitability than that of the valley FSCC. In both highland systems, farmers followed extensive cattle raising with low use of external inputs. For the economic dimension, these were similar to that of the valley MFS. Nevertheless, for the environmental dimension both highland systems were better (diversity of grasses, backyard animals, cattle breeds, and woody fodder crops) than the valley systems. Particularly, the highlands MFS had the greatest proportion of forested land and grasslands with scattered trees, as well as the abundance of wild fauna. For the social dimension, both the FSSC had a higher level of technical assistance and training, less dependence on subsidies, and a greater capacity to cover their basic purchased-food costs than the two MFS. The highlands MFS had the highest number of family beneficiaries, while the highlands FSSC had a higher level of membership in farmers´ organizations than did both types of valley systems. Implications: The valley farmers should reduce their environmental impacts and maintain and even increase productivity, in the case of the mixed family system. The highlands farmers should increase productivity, and reduce their dependence on subsidies. Conclusions: In order to overcome the multidimensional limitations and increase the sustainability of family cattle raising systems, it is necessary that external social actors promote agroecology and silvopastoral systems, as well as the famers´ co-responsibility and active participation along the process.

A critical first phase culminating in recently signed agreements recognizing the reduction of 12 million tCO2e emissions fixed in regenerated forestland and forest fires control with the World Bank, and 14.7 million tCO2e for the results-based payment with the Green Climate Fund. The country has committed to become CO2 neutral by 2050. Achieving this goal entails a paradigm shift in all productive sectors towards carbon neutrality; either by reducing emissions or by compensating at the national or international level. For Costa Rica, this means transforming the transportation sector, ensuring the most effective and efficient use of the forest cover that exists today, and shifting the focus from a primarily quantitative measurement of forest cover to one that further values the qualitative benefits of species utilized and services produced. In addition, halting deforestation in sensitive areas, increasing forest coverage in areas still available (approximately 3% for forest and 5% for agroforestry) incorporating agroforestry, silvopastoral and multi-use systems that will allow for more sustainable production systems increasing ecosystem services. Efforts are being undertaken to upgrade the PES scheme towards ensuring negative CO2 emissions from the land use sector to compensate those from other economic sectors. For its success, this new generation scheme – PES 2.0 – must increase ecosystem services beyond traditional forest service, promote conversion of land under agricultural production (i.e. cattle and diary) into agroforestry operations, and increase its long term socio-economic sustainability.

The methodology that is used in this work consists on analyzing the context and the sense in which business angels are cited, in a descriptive way, annually, from the first mention of the concept to the present in the European Union regulations; making use, simultaneously, both of jurisprudence and of specific literature that can strengthen the partial conclusions that are being extracted. The aim of this study is to detail the treatment that the European Union gives to it. In this way, it can be observed some results. First of all, it is noted that the treatment that business angels receive from the UE is progressive and parceled out. The references to the US market are always present, being used for comparative purposes. The approach that the European Union attributes to it is economic rather than legal, but it does not stop having a presence throughout its regulations. This is the way how it is intended to be studied here. In this sense, from the point of view of economic literature, the concept of business angels is widely used, but the origin of the term is discussed by authors. However, there is no doubt that it falls within the scope of investment, since it is included by The Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, in Article 126, not only as a priority, but also in the area of so-called «private investment». Secondly, it is pointed that business angels differ from venture capitalists, venture lenders, Late-Stage Funders, accelerators and Crowdfunding; and so that, it is studied how investors have developed themselves into networks and large investment funds. As a result, business angels have many particular characteristics. They are considered to be the angels of businesses or companies, whose main function consists on investing, privately, providentially, without official status, with independence, and without any institutional character, prevailing their informal nature and avoiding their quotation on the stock market, making use of previous success as former managers of companies, financing agents or intermediaries who, using their wealth, provide, mainly, financing and knowledge to those companies that are either innovative or new to the market, but that have a growth potential that is superior to the average. These characteristics include the risk that business angels assume in the possible unfavorable market in which they intend to land. Nevertheless, in order to capture their investment, they usually work at the individual level, as a partner, or in the same way, financing rounds. Such is the economic repercussion that its activity may have in the States, that its diffusion is considered essential, by the markets, at a cross-border level, due to the fact that they improve the fiscal environment and they foster the entrepreneurship. This is because their capitals are patient and they are used to moving in risky markets. In conclusion, the existence of business angels is presupposed in the European Union market. It is due to the inheritance of their conception in the United States. Undoubtedly, their de facto existence and the need for them in the market is manifest, within the creation of a competitive market in the EU. In fact, statistics are showing an important increase of business angels per country. However, the focus of the regulations of the European Union on recognizing their importance in the market is so obvious that it relegates the position in which the subjects, on which these business angels project their investment, remain. The European Union insists on the protection of the investor’s position, proposing plans, communicating intentions, raising incentives, among other measures, but forgets the protection of the individual or legal entity on which the investor sets his sights. There is a lack of specific regulations in this regard. For its part, the Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 focuses on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure, but does not directly address the figure of the investor in the sense of business angels. It treats the investment from the internal point of view, either of the company, as a legal entity, or of that carried out by the own natural person, in both cases as «holder of a trade secret» and on the investment that is made on that secret. However, it does not deal with the moment when the investor is made aware of the idea; due to the fact that this is a preliminary moment and it is unusual to sign «confidentiality agreements», «contractual obligations» or other «non-disclosure obligations» when it is the natural or legal person the one who seeks to raise funding. Hence, due to the need of being financed, people with entrepreneurial initiatives assume this risk ipso facto. At this moment, the confrontation or union between the intellectual property right1, trade secrets and that need of being financed arises. © 2021 Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia.

Thus, the system provides enough accessible and harmless food to the locals. In South America, the Pacific hydrographic region has hosted societies that created food systems that evolved from self-sufficient to open to economic chains. This has an impact on the management of production areas in the territory. Since pre-Hispanic times, territory-adapted food systems were developed, which were focused on managing several production areas distributed in a group of basins. Nevertheless, the creation of large cities in this region, such as Metropolitan Lima, have resulted in the relocation of production areas out and away from their territory, which allows to differentiate what is local and what is external. Although the metropolis became a strong economic hub that contributes to the development of global and domestic economic chains; population growth and unplanned urbanization have caused soil degradation and the reduction of arable land (supplied to the real estate market), relegating the local metropolitan territory to food trade and consumption. In consequence, the food system is vulnerable to global or domestic crisis scenarios that could interrupt the external production process. This research analyzes the historical transformation of Lima’s food system to reflect on the local territory’s contribution to food security. © 2023, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

Nowadays, there is an increasing interest by social scientists to assess its implications. Especially, it is relevant to the potential changes and landscape deterioration on population, economic systems and feedbacks of local societies to such adjustments. Assessing social facets should also be related to desertification risks, integrated socio-economic inputs and environmentally sustainable development perspectives. However, investigations about the effects of land degradation conditioned by global socioeconomic-factors from a holistic point of view are scarce. In this review, we pretend to discuss past and recent findings on land degradation risks related to poverty, especially based on Mediterranean Europe. To achieve this goal, we focused on key socioeconomic forces such as developmental policy, production and market structure, social change and population mobility. Our review showed that regional disparities based on complex dynamics of demographic forces (e.g. migration, fertility and ageing) and economic drivers of change (e.g. industrial concentration, urbanization, crop intensification, tourism pressure, coastalization) are keys to understand Mediterranean regions such as Southern Italy, a region exposed to high desertification risk in Europe. We concluded that the overexploitation of territories, soil and water degradation urban expansion, tourism and unplanned industrialization are some sectors and activities which can be highly affected by political and socioeconomic forces leading to unsustainable forms of land management and types of development. Special attention should be paid to social policies, education and training schemes to reduce rural migration and potentiate territorial knowledge to avoid land degradation, considering other social issues such as poverty or centralization. The potential role of win-win policies abating poverty and reducing desertification risk is evident in Mediterranean Europe and achieving land degradation neutrality necessary. © 2021, The authors.","Land degradation; Regional geographical disparities; Social processes; Southern Europe","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123379717"

As a consequence of the growing international quinoa demand, in the last 10 years the cultivated area in Peru has increased, from diversified production systems for self-consumption to monocultures with improved varieties compliant with market characteristics demanded. Objective. Evaluate farmer type and characteristics and their quinoa production units (QPU) based on land tenure, cultivation area, sowing intention, yield and family income. Methodology. Surveys were applied in five communities with the highest quinoa production with structured questions that incorporate economic, environmental and social variables. For the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, statistical tools of multivariate analysis were used. To express the variables in a set of linear combinations of factors not correlated with each other, principal components analysis (PCA) was used; meanwhile, a cluster analysis was performed from the grouping of the QPU with minimum and maximum intra and inter-class variability. Implications. Knowledge of agroecosystems characteristics and the type of farmer who manages production units is the basis of all research, planning and the technology transfer processes. Conclusions. Three types of quinoa farmers and belong to family farming systems in the process of from articulation to market, were identified. The first group with limited access to land, water, and capital resources makes their exploitation difficult. Meanwhile, the second and third groups, denominated smallholders and medium holders, have land with better resources, but their difficulties persist surpluses that allow them to be capitalized. In the three groups, families carry out activities inside and outside the QPU, to generate additional income beyond their main crop. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

The objective is to investigate the figure of the agrarian park for the protection and enhancement of agricultural territories and its articulation with new residential uses. To do this, primary and secondary sources of information were analyzed along with semi-structured interviews with local actors and direct observation in fieldwork based on a case of study: the department of Guaymallén, in the province of Mendoza (Argentina). The characteristics of the case are analyzed through the analysis of the cultural landscape, and the articulation between natural and cultural factors generates a singular landscape in the urban-rural interface. The agrarian park allows the expression of social, economic, and environmental benefits for protecting and enhancing agricultural landscapes and creating complementary activities for residential uses that are established nearby.

To do that, we use data on 64,548 farms reporting revenues and costs in the Encuesta Nacional Agropecuaria. Using the location of each parcel within the farm, we match net revenues with long-term climate, short-term weather events, soil types, plot characteristics, water access, market access, and sociodemographic characteristics. The main results indicate that 45% of farms in the sample observe negative net revenues. Overall, the probability of getting losses increases when the farmer is a woman, recognizes himself as indigenous, has less education, uses oxen, uses less land (small-sized), has rainfed land, has ejidal land, or his agricultural fields are at high levels of altitude. © 2024 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Economía.","agricultural; livestock; Logit model; Net revenues","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181822835"

Although the problem of dispatch of thermal units has been dealt in other research, in the present study it is considered as an objective function of dispatch of thermal units through their linear production cost with the consideration of binary constraints. The firefly algorithm has proven to have a high optimization capacity to determine an optimal point based on behavioral characteristics of nature such as genetic algorithms, but it is differentiated by the ability to make small adjustments near the solution. The firefly algorithm is implemented as an alternative solution due to that the mathematics classic methods present limitations in searching of the optimal solution for this kind of problems. The firefly swarm algorithm associates the objective function with light intensity, this property based in the brightness modifies the behavior of fireflies and makes possible a more rapid convergence towards global solutions.

In Mexico, 85% of the national production comes from plantations of small producers, they are mainly rural landholders from “ejido” communities. The way in which the peasants have carried out the productive reconversion of their lands is important to understand the social and environmental impacts associated with oil palm cultivation. Objective: The process of oil palm productive reconversion, its implications on land use and the associated impacts in terms of job and income generation, is described through the case study of a peasant community located in the state of Campeche with more than 20 years of experience working the crop. Methodology: Two surveys were applied to the community. One with a socioeconomic focus and the other with a productive approach. The former was applied to a representative sample of households (n = 60), and the latter to a representative sample of palm growers (n = 20). The first survey was aimed to describe the role of oil palm has played as a source of jobs and income, while the second focused on describing the process of productive reconversion, its implications on land use and management practices of rural plantations. The results obtained were analyzed in a participatory manner in a focus group organized in the community. Results: Oil palm is the main source of employment for half of the families in the community. Households with oil palm plantations have an income 2.7 times higher than the community average. The productive reconversion has been carried out on previously deforested lands for extensive cattle ranching and has slowed down the praderization of peasant plots. Oil palm plantations have low technology, low use of labour and inputs, and low productivity. Implications: Oil palm has become the most important land use second only to extensive cattle ranching. The farmers have important limitations that prevent them from the consolidation of the crop, which in the medium term may compromise its continuity. This would represent a high opportunity cost since oil palm has become the main productive activity that generates income and jobs in the community. Conclusion: In social terms, oil palm has proven to be effective and improve the living conditions of producers and their families, meanwhile in environmental terms it has not generated deforestation. There are important windows of opportunity to increase the productivity of peasant plantations so that the crop can be consolidated as a factor of economic and social development in rural communities. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

The objective of this study was to identify the main anthropogenic activity that has contributed to reducing mangrove coverage in the lower basin of the Coatzacoalcos River, using two methods: 1) comparing mangrove areas and urban development, between 1986 and 2016, with Landsat and Sentinel images (scale 1: 250 000), using Q-Gis version 214.2; and 2) through a matrix of maximums and minimums, where values were assigned to rate the degree of affectation of anthropic actions to each component of the ecosystem. Between 1986 and 2016, mangrove loss was 86%, and it is associated with the increase in human settlements in the lower basin of the Coatzacoalcos River. The actions that most affected the environmental components were human settlements, land clearings and landfills, livestock, and industrial sites with affected percentages of 15.9, 15.7, 15.5, and 13.5%, respectively. The most affected environmental components were soil, flora, and water, with percentages of affectation of the resource of 17, 17, and 16 %, respectively. Human settlements are the leading cause of loss of mangroves in the lower basin of the Coatzacoalcos River, particularly the irregular settlements that occur in the region. © 2020 Los Autores.

The coastal area of Tabasco is very important for economic development because of the large coastal wetland areas that flow into the Gulf of Mexico. However, coastal wetlands are strongly altered by the change in land use due to their proximity to urban areas, oil extraction and agricultural activities. They are also severely threatened by climate change and sea level rise. This study analyzed the change in land use in Carmen-Pajonal-Machona lagoon system on Tabasco coast through Land Change Modeler during 2000-2015. A probabilistic-spatial scenario was generated in 2030 through Markov Chains and Cellular Automata, detecting that secondary vegetation, wetlands, and acahuales altogether decreased 14 238 hectares from 2000-2015. These changes have affected the reduction of coastal habitats and lead to high flood risks for the population in this area. Additionally the 2030 projection shows alarming values because the ecosystems reflect a loss of 8090 hectares if no change in favor is performed in the paradigm of coastal soil management. Therefore, future trends in land use change on the coast of Tabasco can be mitigated through the implementation of sustainable development policies that involve short- and medium-term planning of the establishment of Territorial Planning programs and the creation of Protected Natural Areas. © 2021 Mexican Society of Soil Science.

The (imperative) need for tourism policies to be sustainable is forcing the gestation of measures so far unthinkable, which go through the limitation of the number of visitors in their different manifestations. This article sets out as a fundamental objective the analysis of the causes of tourist overcrowding, which go through a strictly numerical promotion of the number of visitors or the incentive of tourist holiday housing; Likewise, the impact of the massification on the price of housing, the expulsion of the resident population, or the generation of social conflicts and phobic tourism is studied. The methodology followed for this article consists of an analysis of the sociological and anthropological changes experienced mainly in Spain (and the rest of Europe) and Brazil, and the revision of the existing regulations, in order to confirm whether it is still useful for the purpose pursued., or if on the contrary it should be subject to review. As the reader will check next, the latter is the result achieved, always from the perspective of reconciling tourism as an economic activity, and the preservation of the environment.

Confirmatory bias in scientific communities limits their growth and development by making it difficult for dominant ideas to be replaced by those emerging from new research. I present four groups of findings that challenge well established dominant views (consensus) in the community of ecologists: 1) habitat fragmentation does not generally result in biodiversity losses at the landscape scale, 2) non-native species invasions contribute to increases in biodiversity of plant communities and may even contribute to a diversification explosion during the Anthropocene, 3) planetary primary productivity is increasing, the global area of forests is not decreasing, desertification and burnt area are not expanding (there is no generalized ‘degradation’ of ecosystems), and 4) organic agriculture and landscapes mixing agriculture with (semi) natural ecosystems generally result in decreases in yield, which (in contrast, for example, with GMO-based agriculture) increases the demand for land, further threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services of natural ecosystems. I propose five non-exclusive hypothetical mechanisms to explain the confirmatory bias in ecology: Intellectual conservatism, aesthetic and ideological preferences, and the influence of political-institutional and economic power. Challenging established consensus on the basis of new information should imply disruptive changes in the scientific and political agendas which had them as their foundation. The earlier this happens, the faster science will advance and the more effective environmental policies will be. In order to make this happen, I suggest the scientific and educational agenda should be specifically directed to counter the confirmatory bias by promoting critical thinking. © 2022, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

The sector also generates high redistribution of wealth and the integration of peoples, being also a driver of peace and friendship of peoples. So, it can be said that it is not only a generator of economic wealth but of social wealth, which gives it a unique characteristic compared to other productive sectors. With this background, it cannot be less than understood that the planning process for the sector is of fundamental importance even more so when, being a relatively young and extremely dynamic sector, it needs theoretical-conceptual foundations that, combined with permanent experimentation, favor its development. The planning of the sector in its macro scope, corresponds as responsibility to the public sector the same that, must count among the important initial elements, the way in which the use of the land that will be destined for tourism management will be conceived.

This paperpresents a review of the basic conceptual and methodological tools to analyze the drought risk in a given system. The fundamental components of risk are described, conceived primarily as a function of hazard (or specific danger, which in this case is the drought phenomenon), exposure (people, property, livelihoods, and systems that are subject to potential damage and loos due to hazard) and vulnerability (represented by the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the system that make it susceptible to suffering damage). The concepts and definitions associated with these components are explained and the most usual mathematical methods and models for calculating them are presented. It is concluded that, given the great diversity of approaches, concepts and methods to determine drought risk, it is at the discretion of the researcher or evaluator the selection of the most appropriate depending on the approach adopted, the information available and the objective or investigation context. © 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

In recent years, several studies have contributed to provide information to assess the problem. Some of them are based on analysing biophysical and socio-economic variables using artificial intelligence techniques. For example, artificial intelligence have been used to complete anomaly data for water storage estimation, accurate identification of land cover, estimation of global daily solar radiation and improved climate predictions, and others. Although their use is not yet widespread, the future in desertification studies looks promising. In this paper we review the potential of artificial intelligence techniques (machine learning and deep learning) in the study of desertification and its recent growth in recent years. During the period 2015-2020 the number of publications implementing deep learning increased by 63%, while for machine learning its growth was more modest at 3%. In particular, when we look for studies related to desertification, the growth figures are more striking: an average increase of 103% in studies with deep learning, and 43% in machine learning. However, more studies and efforts are needed to bring together all the disciplines involved in the study of desertification in order to obtain a global and transversal vision of this phenomenon and thus design effective actions to mitigate or anticipate its adverse effects. © 2021 Los Autores.

However, due to inadequate soil management in the basin, the reservoir is accumulating a high sediment load. The decision made by the reservoir administration was to raise its elevation, without considering working alongside farmers in the basin, proposing alternatives for sustainable soil management. In this context, the objective of this study was to estimate the sediment export by simulation soil management and conservation practices, using the sediment delivery ratio module (SDR) in the InVEST 3.9.0 software, to suggest adequate practices for the conditions of the soil watershed. Sediment export based on land use change over the last 30 years was also modeled. This study contributes as an instrument for the integrated water resources management (IWRM), which allows a balance between the users of the water resources (beneficiaries) and suppliers, who have their soils degraded. Thus, IWRM can go from being a simple intention, to a key tool to promote policies and international agreements, toward the generation of clean and abundant water for both countries. At the same time, it favors the management and conservation of the soil of the basin and its related resources, to maximize economic and social welfare in an equitable manner for both countries. © 2022, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

Its purpose is to ensure the correction of negative and large scale environmental impacts, giving a final use to the rehabilitated land. Nickel mining activity is one of the most important sectors of the Cuban national economy, due to the level of contributions that it generates to Gross Domestic Product. This activity, because of its nature, tends to be unsustainable because it devastates the ecosystems located in the deposit. That is why there is an immediate need to propose a solution from the different sciences, specifically from the Economic Sciences. The objective of this paper is to incorporate the economic, environmental and social dimensions in the mining rehabilitation process through the conception of a management model that contributes to the achievement of sustainable development. A documentary analysis of specialized scientific and technical literature was carried out which reflects the environmental problems that affect the Municipality of Moa due to the strip mining of nickel. As a result, an environmental management model for mining rehabilitation is proposed that allows taking adequate advantage of the scenario affected by this type of activity in order to reduce the impact of ecosystems and increase the quality of life of the inhabitants. © 2019 Universidad de Caldas.

The essential sources used in the research were the compilations of historical documents made during the 1960s and 1970s by the Council of Scientific and Humanistic Development (CDCH) of the Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV), as well as by the Congress of the Republic in 1980. After the synthesis of the historical forms of production, the essential features of the exploitation, appropriation, and transmission of land ownership are analyzed, highlighting the expropriations by the opposing sides in the successive wars, the importance of looting in the appropriation of goods, racism as an ideological justification and the decline of slavery as a form of appropriation of labor in the 19th century. The study also showed that the forms of illegal appropriation of land (such as the illegal/informal market, occupations of all kinds, including the deviant application of legal texts) became the norm. Likewise, the will to prevent the realization of a reliable cadaster by successive governments in these centuries favored such de facto situations. Paradoxically, the most recent agrarian policies (in particular, the agrarian laws of 1960 and 2001) have not significantly influenced the evolution of land appropriation or theconcentration of land ownership, but they allowed the play of factors such as the informal market and local pacts. In terms of the appropriation of labor, at the beginning of the period studied, slavery and the coercive appropriation of manumiso’s labor predominated, and although there have been many subsequent regulations to regulate it, in practice it continues to be very complex and fluctuating. Therefore, the evolution of both the appropriation of labor and land has been obsolete in the face of the economic and technological evolution registered during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. © 2020, Centro de Investigaciones Agroalimentarias (CIAAL).

Therefore, in this paper, an analysis of structural change for the period of 2003-2012 has been performed, from the social accounting matrix constructed for Mexico for each of these years, following a methodology of linear multiplier. For this, a social accounting Matrix is constructed for 2012, with the last update realized by INEGI (by its acronym in Spanish), called SAMMEX-12. From this matrix and MCS-Mx03, an analysis of structural change of the Mexican economy was carried out. The methodology of linear multipliers consists in the extension of the Input-Output analysis, but resumed towards the social accounting matrix, since it allows to close the circular flow of the income, impossible situation following the traditional analysis Input-output. With a social accounting matrix, a high level of disaggregation is achieved, to the extent that existing information allows it. These models capture the total effect on each of the endogenous variables that exerts a unitary impact on an exogenous variable as follows: ym = M · Xm Where, M is the linear multipliers matrix and shows the impact generated by a unitary increase in exogenous accounts on income from endogenous accounts. As a result of this, first of all, key sectors have been determined, followed by Economic Landscape to identify intersectoral relations, and accounting multipliers are decomposed to determine the direct, indirect and induced effects of an exogenous unit impact, and finally to determine labor multipliers. Among the main results is that 2012 continues to be as key sectors to Trade and Real Estate Services. This classification confirms the Mexican economic reality, as its economy has been export-oriented and is the sector that represents higher proportion of GDP, as the strategic sector for 2012 was identified by manufacturing industries, reinforcing its importance as a leading supplier of intermediate goods and engine of the economy. The same proportion was done for drivers for the year 2003, except for Corporations for 2012 which rank as driver. Finally, Mining and Electricity sectors remain independent. Similarly, it was identified that the manufacturing industries and real trade reflect the greatest economic impact to interact with all productive sectors. However, the strongest intersectoral relationship is given with manufacturing and educational services. This analysis determined that for the period 2003-2012 a strong structural change was not detected, despite the global crisis presented in that period. A situation arose through the inter-relationships shown in economic landscape, although there has been a shift of sectors on their level of importance as growth drivers, also noted a loss of capacity to generate employment. Moreover, with regards to multiplier decomposition in 2003, it was detected that the sectors had the greatest overall effect on the economy which were legislative activities, electric energy and building, while the year 2012 was detected with a greater total effect to legislative activities, educational services and health services. Instead, the greatest direct effect for 2003 and 2012 was presented by electrical energy. For both years, the highest indirect effect was presented by electric energy and the largest induced effect was presented by the Educational Services. However, the sectors with the greatest change from one year to another were health services, educational Services, transportation and warehousing. Finally, although the sectors with the greatest capacity to generate employment for that period remain stable, the sector with the largest capacity was the primary sector, followed by other services and supportive business services. The sector with the lower capacity to generate jobs was the Mining sector, Corporate and Real Estate Services. It was noted that for 2012 even though the same structure was like that of 2003, the employment generation capacity decreased significantly.

First, an analysis of the relationship between the Constitution and the economy (II) is developed, emphasizing the relationship between economic activity and the emergence of the State (also defining concepts such as ordoliberalism and «economic constitution»). Next, a proposal to reform the Spanish Constitution is proposed (focused on three aspects: single market, defence of competition and efficiency of public services). Finally, the study ends with a brief section of conclusions that claim the need to introduce these changes in our constitutional text. As for the economic model established by constitutions, national constitutional courts have adopted a position that may seem contradictory: on the one hand, they claim (in a more or less explicit way) a supposed neutrality with respect to the economic activity, although within the constitutional framework, avoiding to pronounce on the specific model and its content; on the other hand, they carry out a validity control of economic measures based on their quality as the last defender of the Constitution and the social model that it establishes. Finally, they are reluctant to fill the category of economic constitution with content, preferring to maintain a semantic concept and avoiding to take a step forward in order to establish an authentic normative category similar to a sort of «block of economic constitutionality». Basically, this study makes three proposals to reform our Constitution. The first is about the economic model. In my opinion, one could opt for recognition in the preliminary title of the Constitution of the economic system that the Spanish Constitution would opt for, which would be the social market economy (while the term «ordoliberal» is perhaps rather scientific-technical in nature). Although this concept would, of course, be developed later, it would allow constitutional jurisprudence to protect a minimum content that endows the constitutional declaration with consistency and effects and protects the system against an overly interventionist legislator or intended to end public services (equated here with the concept of social rights). It can be argued that article 38 already mentions the «market economy», although it could also be stated that this declaration, outside the preliminary title (which permeates the rest of the constitutional text), would have a more limited scope. Secondly, in line with the proposed adaptation of our regulation, there would be other aspects that could also be developed, such as considering the right to property of article 33 as a fundamental right (including the limitations derived from the social function, of course) or the freedom of enterprise of article 38. Likewise, the recognition of professional associations does not seem to be included in the constitutional text (currently, article 36), but it seems more convenient that the law itself should be subject to its regulation in those cases in which there is really a public interest that justifies the closing of the market that such an organization is operating. Finally, we should specify what is meant by an ordoliberal reform. In short, it would seek to strengthen (or establish) a genuine single market in Spain, to guarantee free competition and to ensure efficient and quality public services (as social rights). That would be the final and last goal of this proposal: to have a market open to competition and efficient, attractive to operators and allowing an economic activity that leads to a high level of revenue. This would ensure the necessary funds to guarantee efficient and quality public services that are necessary in a modern, social and democratic State of Law and quality. Thus, the objective of this study is simply to focus on some aspects, that is to say, more functional, less existentialist, but absolutely necessary in the event of a reform of the Constitution. Neither the crisis of representative democracy, the electoral system, nor the autonomic state are mentioned here (although their inefficiencies are related to what is proposed here). On the contrary, there is a more pragmatic or functional reform proposal, less elevated in the Theory of the Constitution, but whose results would contribute to a substantial improvement of public affairs. Basically, three goals are proposed: to achieve a genuine national single market, to make free competition constitutional and to achieve a more efficient administration (although only the aspect related to duplicities has been developed here). A critical reader could point out that none of these (more or less reasonable) proposals would need to be included in the constitutional text. It would simply be possible to do so by legal means. It could also be said to that commentator that formal norms would not be necessary either, but that a change of culture would be enough. Also, that some of those measures already seemed to be included in our law. In any case, the jurisprudential practice and the dynamics of institutions in our country seem to demonstrate that the constitutional guarantee is perhaps the most efficient one to achieve the change for different reasons: for the hierarchical supremacy of the text, because it informs the rest of the norms and for the renewed legitimacy implied by any reform process. It is not about establishing a too exhaustive constitutional code that ends up petrifying the legal order, but it is about getting some basic principles in a constitutional way that, given the functions that today are demanded from the public power, seem to be the most reasonable ones. © 2018 Ministerio de Empleo y Seguridad Social.

Consequently, different societies can experience different perceptions of the same phenomenon (Sardi et al. 2012). In regions where recent changes on the land use are recorded, the diversity of views of different social actors is important to be considered (Sánchez-Vázquez et al. 2016). Latin American peasant perspective of the environment and their ways of living can be found in the works of Gerritsen et al. (2003), Chávez-García (2011), and Flores-Moreno & Valdivia-Corrales (2012). In Argentina, there are many investigations about peasantry focusing on the territoriality and the mechanisms of social reproduction (Torres et al. 2014). In the current work, perceptions and assessments of a community of farmers from the Southwest of La Pampa province, Argentina, are analyzed considering the emic perspective. In particular, our study addresses the knowledge of this community about forage resources and limiting factors for production, and how changes in the environment since the 1990 decade up to now have affected their way of life. The emic approach takes social actor’s subjectivities to understand the natural environment (Arenas & Martínez 2012). However, analyzing this information, consequently the etic perspective is recorded too. The aim of our work is to record: A) the farmer’s knowledge about plant forage resources and the perception of the restricting factors for production, b) their perception about the evolution of their own quality of life along time, c) their strategies to increase economic incomes, and d) their opinion about the advance of the oil frontier in the region. Locals in the study area are farmers that belong to the socio-economical category of peasantry, and are bearers of a rich traditional knowledge (Muiño 2010). Methods: The study area is located in Puelén, in the Southwest of La Pampa province, Argentina (Fig. 1). The area is part of the phytogeographical province of Monte where “jarillas” (Larrea spp.) are the dominant species. Soils are sandy, and rocky outcrops and salt lakes are common. Mean annual precipitation is 300 mm. In this region the frontier of oil industry is advancing over natural pasture lands. The main production of the settlers is extensive stockbreeding of cows and goats, which provides low economic incomes. Field work initially consisted of open interviews and latter of semi-structured interviews to twenty adult farmers. The information about the environment and particularly forage resources was recorded according to the usual protocol for ethnobotanical investigations (Arenas & Martínez 2012). Open interviews were used to formulate new questions in subsequent field work. For each plant species mentioned by farmers, a voucher was collected and deposited in the Herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de La Pampa (SRFA). The aims of this work were previously explicated to interviewees and the authors relied on their consent for the investigation. Results: Forage plants: According to farmer’s responses, the best forage species for cows in the region is “coirón” (Pappostipa speciosa (Trin. & Rupr.) Romasch.). This species is, however, highly sensitive to drought, as indicated by 35% of interviewees. The most important species in the diet of goats are Prosopis flexuosa DC var depressa F.A. Roig, Lycium chilense Miers ex Bertero, Condalia microphylla Cav., Monttea aphylla (Miers.) Benth. & Hook., Atriplex lampa (Moq.) D.Dietr. and Cyclolepis genistoides Gillies ex D.Don. In turn, the diet of cows is mainly composed of Nassella tenuis (Phil.) Barkworth, Lycium chilense, Panicum urvilleanum Kunth, Poa ligularis Nees ex Steud., Atriplex lampa, and Schismus barbatus (L.) Thell. Total forage species and their preference by cattle is represented in Table 1. In general, forage availability is considered as to be highly dependent on rain, and when rain occurs after a long drought period, the pasture recovers from the seed bank. This experience prompts farmers to avoid reducing stocking density during droughts because reducing the herd means losing capital. Perceptions of the restricting factors for production and life quality: Three restricting factors were mentioned for stockbreeding. The most important was drought (70% of interviews).Shallow soils that means low water retention capability, and the falling of volcanic ashes, that limits cattle foraging, reached in both cases 10% of interviews. In 50% of the answers, the opinion was that in past times people had a better life quality than at present. In contrast, only 5% of the answers indicated that at present, life quality is better than in the past. Farmers proposing that past times were better argued that rain and snow were more abundant in the past. Those weather conditions allowed denser animal flocks and, consequently, higher annual incomes. Land owning and use were other two topics mentioned during interviews. In the past, fields without fences allowed farmers to do a broader use of forage resources. Grazing in fields without fences ensured them subsistence probabilities in drought times because cattle could explore broader areas. Currently, new farmers have a different and modern perspective about production. They usually fence their plots and invest in technology, altering the traditional way of cattle management. The sale of wild animal skins represented another source of income in the past. Currently, protective policies against this trade force farmers to sale, instead, goat skins. The price of the skin of these domestic animals is, however, so low that their commercialization is usually abandoned. Strategies for increasing incomes and opinions on the advance of oil extraction activities: Production diversification and the use of animal derivatives are strategies for increasing familiar incomes through the sale of fowls and cheese. In some cases, an increase of the production profitability is sought through genetic improvement in goats. From 1990s, the “red goat”, a local ecotype with higher meat production, more resistant to cold and with fur that allows the production of mohair has been developed in the region. When farms are within the oil exploitation area, alternative ways of incomes include economic activities conducted outside their property and economic compensations from oil companies. Farms that earn this type of extra incomes are the 30% of the total in the oil extractive area. In relation to the advance in the last years of the oil frontier, the 35% of the interviewees had a favorable opinion because they are expecting extra incomes by easements, and 15% opposes to that economic opportunity because of the damages and contamination that companies cause. Discussion: Some of the taxa mentioned as good quality forage are considered as indicators of pastures with poor conditions or low forage in other grazing areas of Argentina with higher precipitation (Kröpfl &Villasuso 2012). In the study area, vegetation structure, forage supply and accessibility and marked plant phenology are all variables that influence the cattle´s preference by plants (Velázquez-Vélez et al. 2009). The perception of losing life quality is based on the idea that the weather is currently drier than before. Historical rainfall records indicate, however, the opposite trend (Casagrande et al. 2006). In relation to this perception, no information was recorded about overgrazing effects; that is, interviewees do not associate the degradation of the natural environment to holding high stocking densities during drought periods. This perception is consistent with peasant rationality recorded in other social works in Argentina (Bendini & Pescio 1999). As with overgrazing, there are another environmental processes, invisible to farmers because they became used to them, such as wind, water erosion and fires (Dussart et al. 2015). These processes, isolated or combined, reduce the grazing area year after year, but none of them were noticed by the interviewees. The naturalization of some restricting environmental factors was pointed out in other works about peasant societies (Stadel 1989), and may be related to a difficult access to technical information. The advance of oil production in the area and changes in the possession and use of land are fast processes that are promoting changes in the society with unknown projections and consequences. Near this region, in other oil extractive areas, the damage of natural resources has been recorded just as its negative incidence on local economies (Schweitzer 2011, D’Amico 2012). Incomes that farmers get from oil companies have an ambiguous effect on the domestic economy. On one hand, those incomes can be the main revenue, what means a high dependence on them. Furthermore, as a result of the gradual worsening of traditional economies, those incomes tend to become the main earning for families, slowly neglecting alternative survival strategies linked to peasant culture (Cáceres 2014). In our opinion, these changes may threaten the persistence of the peasant’s ways of life. Conclusion: In this work, the perceptions of a rural community of farmers that is undergoing several changes are recorded. The persistence of traditional knowledge is presented here by the information about forage plants and the local environmental elements that are the base of the stockbreeding, which is the main economic production of farmers. This knowledge allows a management of landscape according to the breeding activity, but market rules, changes in the possession and use of the land, and the permanent processes of decapitalization are endangering farmers’ way of life. Strategies for improving their incomes are survival and social reproduction methods commonly employed in peasant societies. The different options under consideration in the face of the advance of the oil industry frontier rise doubts, however, about the persistence of this community in the near future. © 2019, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

The nation was just reeling from a first: the President announced a “lockdown” which meant that all economic activity except “essential services” could operate. Life almost ground to halt and South Africans faced a new reality. No movement out of your property unless it was a medical emergency or if you needed to buy food. The minibus taxi, an economic enabler to millions of South Africans also had to stop operating. The South African DoT had a mammoth task of communicating to a range of stakeholders. However, the most sensitive being the minibus taxi owners, drivers and their related associations. How would they accept the news that they will not have a livelihood for the next few weeks or perhaps even months? Given the nature of industrial shift patterns and need for a more flexible transport system for workers, some organisation’s such as Nestlé contracted private transport services to ensure their staff travelled to work safely. Nestlé also had their own compulsory sanitizing protocols in place to support private transporters.

It is a consequence of the natural dynamics of socio-economic systems that regulate man-made tropical forests. However, a significant proportion of studies have made generalizations about the relative values of biodiversity, without taking into account the high levels of internal heterogeneity in the biophysical properties and land uses of each site. The purpose of this study is to propose and validate a methodology to delimit the heterogeneity of the landscape based on criteria that integrate the coupling of human-ecological systems such as: space-time dynamics of deforestation and fragmentation; complexity of the landscape structure; current and historical land use and biophysical variability. For this, the use of satellite images, landscape metrics, field work, documentary review and multivariate analysis were combined. The proposed methodology is intended to help guide the empirical delimitation of landscape heterogeneity as a prerequisite for the selection of similar landscapes and forest patches in studies of the diversity of tree species, in order to provide an opportunity to control the possible difficulties caused by variability in the proportion of forests, landscape configuration and successional states, in estimating its effects on forest richness and floristic composition. © 2018 Los Autores.

To subsist, Huichols are forced to migrate to different regions in the coast of Nayarit state, where they employ in agricultural works such as application of pesticides. Due to different socio-economic and cultural factors, the potential detrimental effects triggered by pesticides exposure in Huichols might be exacerbated, deserving attention. Hence, this article is an exploratory approach of the socioeconomic and cultural aspects involved in the use and management of pesticides in two indigenous communities in the state of Nayarit. The data gathered showed that organophosphates (OP) are the most used compounds. Also, 90% of the population works in activities including sowing, harvesting, cutting and stringing tobacco, as well as in applying and mixing pesticides. Further, 74% workers does not have knowledge of the type of pesticides they handle, and 26% uses more than one pesticide at a time.

In particular, it shows how this behavior could be related to the strengthening of intellectual property legislation and the process of economic liberalization and de-industrialization. The evidence suggests that Intellectual Property Rights –IPRs– have not incentivized local innovation but has only boosted patent applications from non-residents, owned by a few multinational companies in some technological fields. Instead, firms resort to the use of alternative intellectual property mechanisms such as confidentiality agreements and industrial secrecy. This mechanism allows them to manage their knowledge and appropriate the rents associated with their innovation efforts, which are characterized by the imitation and adaptation of foreign technologies. This evidence allows us to discuss the policy of strengthening IPRs and the incentives of invention patents as a mechanism to encourage innovation in Colombia. © 2020, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

Buenos Aires (Argentina) is not an exception to this phenomenon, given that its recent statistics show a growing trend of crimes against people. Poverty can provoke a greater virulence of crime, but the latter also entails social and economic costs that negatively impact welfare and poverty. This paper addresses this second relationship based on the study of changes in the urban configuration and its consequent impact on the welfare of households and firms due to the increase in crime in the city of Buenos Aires. Methodology: A computational general equilibrium model (cge) with urban characteristics for Argentina was developed in 2011 in order to measure welfare changes, generated by the crime and the costs it generates on the real estate market. As real estate prices were the transmission mechanism between crime and welfare, elasticities were estimated between crime and the price of housing based on a hedonic econometric model. Results: Assuming a 10% increase in the crime rate, the prices of real estate in the relatively richer North of the city can fall to 4%, while they fall less than 1% in the South region. The net effect is a significant drop in the average value of real estate in the city, given that the North is where the most expensive properties are concentrated. These asymmetric results between zones of the city are also observed in the results of household welfare, reducing 8% in the North and 1% in the South. These results on property prices and households welfare induce the relocation of households to the South and of firms to the North, which alters the initial urban configuration. The results correspond with the findings for other cities in South America. Conclusions: An increase in crime in the city of Buenos Aires generates non-negligible welfare costs for families, which produces incentives for the relocation not only of families but also of firms. Consequently, the crime does not turn out to be neutral for the urban and regional configuration, given the interactions between the city of Buenos Aires and the rest of the country. Conclusions such as quantitative results are useful for the design of public policies related to local security and its impact on urban configuration. © 2019 Fondo de Cultura Economica.

From a global perspective, considering all types of cooperative firms, comparative evidence in the empirical literature has been developed under two approaches (Sexton and Iskow, 1993, and Soboh et al, 2009). The first focuses on the measurement of financial and economic ratios, while the second relies on the comparison of estimated economic efficiency. Now, this literature, in both approaches, has focused mainly on the agri-food sector (Soboh et al, 2009). Indeed, there are hardly any empirical studies outside the primary sector. And no study provides a general comparison for the Spanish economy comprising all economic sectors; nor compares different sectors, or distinguishes different sizes of companies. The originality of this article lies therein. In the international literature, only Challita et al (2014) has performed a similar work to this one, focussing on France. As per the approach of comparative analysis based on financial ratios, our goals are as follows: - To compare, for the economy as a whole, for all types of cooperatives, the financial ratios of Spanish investor-owned and cooperative firms in the recent crisis period 2008-2015. - To perform the same comparison, but discriminating for economic sectors and firms' size. We base our study on some of the most widely used ratios in the literature, classified in the following categories: financial soundness (solvency, financial autonomy), liquidity, profitability (ROE, ROA) and external financing (indebtedness level and liability structure). The main theoretical hypothesis in the comparison of financial ratios between cooperatives and investor-owned firms, as reflected in the literature, are as follows: - Profitability, which, according to a first hypothesis, is greater in investor-owned firms than in cooperatives, based on the fact that, while the investor-owned firms pursue profit maximization, this goal is not isolated from others in the cooperatives. However, a second hypothesis establishes that profitability will depend on market power in the sector considered. - Solvency is better in investor-owned firms. - With regard to liquidity, there are two hypotheses. Under the first, liquidity would be better in investor-owned firms because of the cooperatives' behaviour, arising from moral hazard issues. Under the second hypothesis, based on an argument of aversion to risk, cooperatives would achieve higher liquidity ratios. - Indebtedness is larger in cooperatives. The source of data for financial ratios is the SABI (Sistema de Análisis de Balances Ibéricos) database. A total of 6,963 firms were randomly selected, comprising of 4,126 investor-owned firms (59.26% of the total) and 2,837 cooperatives (40.74% of the total). The sample covers the period 2008 to 2015, with the average value calculated for the entire period mentioned in each firm in the sample. Because of high dispersion and errors in the data, following a usual statistical procedure the extreme values for each of the variable were identified and removed. The following twelve economic sectors were selected based on the National Classification of Economic Activities (CNAE) for 2009: primary sector, manufacturing and extractive industry and energy and water supply; construction; trade and repair of vehicles; transport and storage, hostelry; information and communication and financial and insurance activities; real estate activities; professional, scientific and technical activities; administrative activities and auxiliary services; education, health and social services activities; and, finally, artistic, recreational activities and other services. Regarding the analysis by size of firms, we have followed the definition by the European Commission. The empirical analysis has consisted in comparing the average value of the different ratios between investor-owned and cooperative firms. As a first step, we have checked the hypothesis of normality of the distributions of each ratio for both types of firms. Virtually all the results of these tests contradict the normality hypothesis. Since in most cases the distribution is not normal, we apply the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for independent samples, so as to check when the distributions of the samples for both types of firms are statistically different. Likewise, we also report the results of the T test for independent samples. In most cases, the two tests give identical results. The analysis of the results consists of comparing the average of the different ratios between both types of firms, as long as the corresponding test shows that the distributions are statistically different. And in such case, and only in such cases, the results of the average are illustrated by Graphs. Likewise, in order to provide more information, we graphically represent the evolution, for the entire analysed period, of each ratio for all firms, and also for cooperatives and investor-owned firms separately. Our findings are as follows. With regard to solvency, in the Spanish economy as a whole, cooperatives are financially sounder than investor-owned firms. This result is further confirmed for microenterprises, as well as in the sectors of industry, construction, trade and repair of vehicles and administrative activities. These findings contradict the hypothesis established in the literature. In con- cluding, it can be said that, during the recent period of economic crisis in Spain, cooperatives have shown higher solvency. In terms of liquidity, for the Spanish economy generally, investor-owned firms show a higher level; however, for micro-enterprises, the opposite is true (although the difference is nearly negligible). By sectors, the liquidity ratio is higher in cooperatives in construction, industry and administrative activities. However, in the primary sector liquidity is higher for investor-owned firms. Therefore, the results are not fully conclusive, according to the two opposite hypotheses hereby explained. Thirdly, investor-owned firms have conclusively earned higher profitability than cooperatives during the recent period of crisis in Spain, which further confirms the hypothesis based on the differing goals of each type of firm. Specifically, regarding financial profitability, the result is very conclusive: both for the economy as a whole, as in the four types of firm sizes, and in most sectors, investor-owned firms attain a much higher financial return than cooperatives. Finally, regarding the financing structure, we conclude that investor-owned firms are more indebted than cooperatives, and, consequently, the hypothesis is not validated. This is true for the economy as a whole, and in eight economic sectors, as well as in micro-enterprises and SMEs. Only in large corporations investor-owned firms are less indebted than cooperatives. Likewise, it is shown that investor-owned firms are commonly more indebted in the long term than cooperatives. Summing up, we can conclude that cooperatives, during the recent period of economic crisis in Spain, have enjoyed a sounder financial structure in the long term, with lower insolvency risk, as well as less indebtedness. Meanwhile, investor-owned firms have conclusively secured a higher profitability and, as a result (although less conclusively so), also higher liquidity. Also, investor-owned firms have a greater share of long-term indebtedness. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.","Capitalist companies; Comparación; Comparative analysis; Cooperativas; Cooperatives; Empresas capitalistas; Financial ratios; Ratios financieros","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053397324"

This article proposes to characterize the different land management models developed and to identify if they conditioned the possibilities of their implementation. Four intervention cases located in central areas of the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires -Avellaneda and the City of Buenos Aires- that reflect management instruments and diverse results are analyzed through a qualitative approach. The analysis shows that certain intrinsically territorial characteristics -such as location, land ownership, the scale of neighborhoods- in relation to the participating actors and the definition of the recipients, conditioned the development of land management instruments and made possible different results. © 2019 Universidad de Chile.

The analysis has been made from the study of the most recent jurisprudence of the Fourth Chamber of the Supreme Court. This work is approached from a systematic and critical perspective. It begins with a brief introduction, in which the evolution of unemployment protection in Spain is explained. The modern protection of unemployment arises in Spain with Law 62/1961, of July 22, which configures a clearly contributory scheme. This scheme is maintained until the Basic Employment Law of 1980, which introduces assistance protection, although within the framework of a mixed scheme. A complementary benefit is created, which consists of an allowance for the unemployed under the conditions of a typically defined assistance benefit: it is necessary to prove a situation of specially qualified need for lacking income above the minimum wage and for having family responsibilities. But the new protection lacks a universal scope, since it only protects those who ""have used up the benefit""; it is, then, a simple continuation of contributory protection subject to the condition of insufficient resources. However, this complementary benefit is going to have non-contributory financing, since the Basic Employment Law foresees a 40% participation of the State in financing. The reform of Law 31/1984 revised the level of assistance, expanding the entries and adjusting the duration. Basically, this line will be maintained in the subsequent reforms which, within this framework, will impose improvements or restrictions depending on the different political situations and financial demands. The last crisis, which began in 2008, has acted in a double direction, because, together with clearly restrictive measures on expenditure, such as the increase of age and the double requirement of income (personal and family) for the subsidy to support retirement, the use of new benefit extensions has also been promoted. After this short presentation, the paper analyses the requirement of insufficient income, as it is currently configured, examining the problems that have been raised in jurisprudence. In the first place, the evolution of the concept of ""income"" in judicial doctrine is explained, going from a civil concept to a concept closer to the fiscal model after Law 45/2002. Then, the paper deals with the subjective income allocation by making a distinction, in this respect, between the requirement of lack of income and that of ""family responsibilities"". The former is a general requirement that only takes the income of the applicant into account and operates as a prerequisite. Only when this generic requirement is fulfilled, it will it be possible to assess, if applicable, the income of the family unit for the purpose of checking whether the additional requirement of family responsibilities is also met. Once it has been clarified that these are two different requirements, each of them is analysed. The personal nature of the income raises the question of the allocation of the spouses' income when the matrimonial economic regime is that of joint property. In relation to this issue, this paper explains that, from the start, jurisprudence opted for the taxation criterion of individual income instead of the civil criterion of accumulation, by distinguishing two assumptions: a) when income is obtained exclusively by the applicant of the subsidy, it should be charged to him in full to determine whether or not the requirement of lack of income is met and this is true even if the marriage is governed by the legal regime of joint property; b) when it is proven that the income in question is obtained by both spouses, it must be divided among them according to their quota of obtaining. This judicial solution is then reflected in the regulatory standard. In this article, a critical assessment of the criterion of individualization is made and some examples are presented in order to show its dysfunctions. Regarding the additional requirement of family responsibilities, it is explained that, in reality, it operates as a double condition: the applicant for the subsidy must have, at least, one family member in charge; if this first requirement is met, a second one must still be met: the family unit, taken as a whole, must not exceed the established income limit. In this sense, it is understood that the relative who is in charge is the one whose income is below the legal limit. In order to determine the income of the family unit on its own, the income of all the members of such unit must be added and the result must be divided by the number of persons that include it, bearing in mind that the unit is also composed of the relatives who are not in charge of the applicant. Subsequently, the specific problems presented by each type of income are analysed: work income, Social Security benefits, capital returns -movable and real estate-, income from economic activities, capital gains and allocation of presumed income. This article concludes by examining the effects produced by the non-fulfilment of the requirement of lack of income and / or family responsibilities on the right to the subsidy that has already been recognized, for which STS (Supreme Court Judgement) 19.2.2016 is analysed in detail (resource 3035/2014). It is an important sentence in which it is clearly stated that the regulation provided for in article 279 LGSS (General Law on Social Security), in relation to the suspension and termination of the right to subsidy, is not contradictory with the provisions of articles 25.3 and 47 of the LISOS (Law on Offences and Penalties in the Social Order), but complementary. If the beneficiary obtains additional income that exceeds the legal threshold and the managing entity is informed, the extinction or suspension of the right will take place, depending on whether the obtaining of this income is maintained for a time equal to or greater than twelve months or it does not reach that time frame. However, if the beneficiary does not inform about it, we move to sanctioning regulations: his behaviour means a serious infraction that, in accordance with the provisions of article 47 of LISOS, is penalised with the extinction of the right to subsidy. After critically evaluating this judgement and the two particular votes that accompany it, this paper defends that it would have been preferable to raise a question of unconstitutionality because the sanctioning regime, at this point, could violate the principles of proportionality and equality. © 2019 Ministerio de Empleo y Seguridad Social.

The objective of this study was to characterize the productive structure, and perform an economic analysis, of the ovine production system in the Bajo Mixe region, in the municipality of San Juan Cotzocon Mixe, Oaxaca. Twenty sheep farmers in three communities, nine in Arroyo Peña Amarilla, six in El Porvenir and five in La Libertad, participated in a survey that included the diagnosis of the sociocultural and economic status of the sheep farmer, and various technical activities. The production system is that known as ""backyard"" or subsistence. The farmers have small grazing herds, labor and scarce agricultural land. The production process is simple and focuses on self-consumption. The farmer has an average of 5.68 years of experience; he owns 10.65 sheep that feed on pastures of 1 ha, with an average stoking rate of 10.65 sheep ha                             -1                             . The facilities are rustic, reproduction is not planned, the supplement is deficient, sanitary control is rudimentary and strategic health programs are limited. In the region, the ""criollo"" sheep have on average life of 3.88 years. The magnitude of the investment, the production costs, and the scarce sales prevent obtaining enough income to cover the costs. To achieve equilibrium it is required to produce 23.1 lambs, which is more than double the average inventory. This fact points to the impossibility of obtaining economic profits in the traditional system. The sheep activity in the region of the Bajo Mixe, maintains low levels of development, productivity and technological adoption. Therefore, the size of the flocks should increase, participation in government support programs should be promoted and each community be organized, in order to obtain scaled benefits.                          © 2018, Colegio de Postgraduados.;                              La investigación sobre sistemas productivos en rebaños pequeños es escasa y es conveniente caracterizar estos sistemas para identificar áreas de mejora potencial. El objetivo de este estudio fue caracterizar la estructura productiva y realizar un análisis económico del sistema ovino en la región Bajo Mixe, en el municipio de San Juan Cotzocón Mixe, Oaxaca. Veinte productores de ovinos en tres comunidades, nueve en Arroyo Peña Amarilla, seis en El Porvenir y cinco en La Libertad, participaron en una encuesta que incluyó el diagnóstico del estado sociocultural y económico del ovinocultor, y actividades técnicas diversas. El sistema de producción es de traspatio o de subsistencia. Los productores poseen rebaños pequeños en pastoreo, mano de obra y superficie agrícola escasos. El proceso de producción es simple y se enfoca en autoconsumo. El productor tiene en promedio 5.68 años de experiencia, posee 10.65 ovejas alimentadas en praderas de 1 ha, con una carga promedio de 10.65 ovejas ha                             -1                             . Las instalaciones son rústicas, la reproducción no se planea, el suplemento es deficiente, el control sanitario es rudimentario y los programas sanitarios estratégicos son limitados. Los borregos criollos tienen una vida promedio de 3.88 años. La magnitud de la inversión, los costos de producción, y las ventas escasas impiden obtener ingresos suficientes para cubrir los costos. Para alcanzar el equilibrio se requiere producir 23.1 borregos, que es más del doble del inventario promedio. Esto apunta a la imposibilidad de obtener utilidades económicas en el sistema tradicional. La actividad ovina en la región del bajo Mixe, mantiene niveles bajos de desarrollo, productividad y adopción tecnológica. Por lo tanto, el tamaño de los rebaños debería aumentar, promover la participación en programas de apoyo gubernamental y cada comunidad organizarse para obtener beneficios de escala.                          © 2018, Colegio de Postgraduados.","Agricultura familiar; Análisis económico; Diagnóstico productivo; Economic analysis; Family farming; Ovejas; Ovis aries; Ovis aries; Productive diagnosis; Productive system; Sheep; Sistema productivo","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061714038"

The P. flexuosa woodlands from the Monte Biogeographic Province are among the most environmentally constrained forest in the country, which suggests the sustainable forest management is difficult to achieve. In this paper, we propose to discuss the environmental determinants of woodland productivity, and to evaluate territorial and management strategies that contribute to increase the sustainability of their use, and to the conservation and restoration of degraded forests. These woodlands show a latitudinal gradient in the population structure; this determines their forestry potential. The woodlands from the Northern sector have trees of greater size and higher growth and productivity, allowing us to think about timber forest management. In the central and southern sectors, in turn, it would only be possible to extract products of lower economic value (i.e., firewood and posts), integrated with extensive livestock and other non-timber products use. Precipitation is the main determinant of livestock carrying capacity, and the history of use has generated different states of woodland degradation. The great challenge is to be able to carry out a territorial planning that takes into account the spatial heterogeneity described above, that improves the technological processes used in order to optimize woodland production, and that makes it possible to decide on the priority activities for each area. The analytical comparison of maps of potential, historical and current distribution is proposed as a tool with strong implications on the woodland management and conservation, since it allows for the discrimination of areas with forest-use potential, reforestation zones and areas with no forest vocation. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

We propose a three-step strategy to evaluate the impact of agricultural mechanization on the sociocultural valuation of landscapes with traditional milpa agriculture. The method entailed the application of semi-structured interviews to 60 settlers from two Mayan communities with different agriculture’s mechanization history. Each interview included general information collection of the respondents as well as three ecosystem services valuation techniques: a free listing, an assessment matrix, and the ranking of the landscape units. These instruments were applied to 60 participants in two Mayan communities differentiated by 30 years from the beginning of agriculture mechanization. The results highlight a similar valuation of ecosystem services in both communities. Communities share 58% of the landscape services listed. Participants in both communities recognize the multifunctional character of the forest. Nevertheless, greater importance was assigned to food provisioning areas: milpa in the traditional community and to mechanized lands in the modernized community. This most significant difference found between communities is explained by the economic income associated with the sale of surpluses in mechanized agriculture. In conclusion, agricultural modernization has not had an important impact on the sociocultural valuation of ecosystem services, but in the importance of the landscape units. In addition, we capture the local recognition of each unit on the provision services relevant for the Mayan way of life, which explains the persistence of these heterogeneous and multifunctional landscapes. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

The worldwide market and consumption of pomegranate fruit (Punica granatum L.) has grown considerably, due to its nutraceutical properties, with a high antioxidant content, generating favorable effects for human health. In Colombia some semi-commercial crops are reported in the departments of Boyaca, Huila and Valle del Cauca. However, it is unknown about its productive behavior, management practices, physiology, development of the phenological stages and pomological characteristics of fruits of native genotypes. Objective. Conduct a review of the aspects related to the crop of pomegranate, analyze possible limitations for its production in Colombia and present information on the pomological characteristics of pomegranate plants grown in home gardens in two regions of Colombia. Methodology. Information was collected from documentary sources related to recommendations applicable to pomegranate cultivation in Colombia. A pomological characterization of fruits of native genotypes from two different agro-ecological zones of the national territory was made. Results. Native genotypes have similar pomological characteristics, but differ considerably from commercial genotypes, the latter being superior in accordance with market requirements for export. Implications. The low technical knowledge on the part of the farmers allows that there are deficiencies in the management of limitations of this crop. Conclusions. The recommendations set forth, complemented with pomological characterization, generate knowledge that can be implemented by producers in Colombia. More research is required if the crop is to be projected as a promising economic alternative to the region. © 2020 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

The present work shows an alternative to the use of compost obtained from the treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste mixed with polystyrene and limestone to replace substrata for urban agriculture and agricultural use. The study included analysis of follow-up questionnaires answered by customers of a composting facility who mix it with other materials to produce substrata for cultivation of vegetables and ornamental plants. From this analysis, mixtures recommended by producers were tested, selecting those with the best results. Then, they were reformulated for comparison with commercial substrata used in urban and protected agriculture through an experimental design of randomized complete block design (RCBD). The experimental tests were performed on specimens of roses and tomatoes subjected to four different treatments. Nutritional properties of the substrate and productivity were evaluated under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. The results show that the proposed biophysical substratum presents physical, chemical, and biological properties that make it a viable substitute for use in urban gardening or protected agriculture. These findings contribute to increase the use of compost as a basis for the development of agricultural substrates, while reducing the environmental impact associated with the extraction of forest soil commonly used in gardening, as well as promoting the possibility of developing more affordable products with better productivity results. © 2018, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

By using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies and combining different information sources (interviews to different social actors, mass media, and government documents), we analyzed the socioeconomic impacts of the Law for the Protection of Native Forests, in the Province of Córdoba (Argentina). The results suggest that the new law prioritize the concept of private property over customary norms, local arrangements, and flexible access to ecosystem services which are major features of the social and productive approach followed by subsistence farmers. Capitalized farmers, holding higher economic and political power, have access to different mechanisms allowing them to lessen the new-laws restrictive effects, and have better chances to receive monetary compensations from the Estate for payments for ecosystem services. Thus, new social conditions emerge, which translate into economic asymmetries and processes of social exclusion among different kinds of farmers settled in the same territory. Those who hold lower political and economic power are the most vulnerable ones (i.e., subsistence farmers) and therefore are the most negatively impacted by the new scenario. In a globalized world dominated by an economy market that prioritizes short-term profits, native ecosystems face growing extractivist pressures, which is generating high social and environmental consequences. The State has the responsibility to protect these threatened ecosystems and to guarantee social wellbeing.

It is specifically centered on problems related to enterprise groups, which have had special relevance in judicial matters. The study starts off with an analysis of the complexity of the employer’s figure, based on the wording of article 1.2 of the ET (the Workers’ Statute). This analysis pays special attention to the appearance of business positions with no clear personal substrate. Following this analysis, we comment on the specific problems of communities of goods, temporal enterprise unions, irregular corporations and companies, communities of property, incumbent inheritances, and a few others. But, because of a new phenomenon, namely that enterprise networks are replacing traditional Ford model organizations, the complexity of the figure of the employer reaches far beyond the aforementioned problems. The location of the business position must take into account these new ways of organization, especially enterprise groups, but also some more typical forms of the modern productive decentralization, like franchises, for example. But recent jurisprudence has been very much focused on the study of enterprise groups and this is the point on which our study focuses as well. The second section examines enterprise group related doctrine from the IVth Chamber of the Supreme Court. It distinguishes between classic and current doctrine. This last one has its origins in the Supreme Court’s judgement of the 27th May 2013, on the Aserpal case. It’s a judgement of great importance, that dictates turn away from previous criteria: traditional doctrine was cleansed and certain ambiguities, piled up over the last years, were cleared away. On the other hand, internal discrepancies in the core of the IVth Chamber were confirmed (specially the judgements in the Metalkris and Servicontrol cases). Trying to fix these discrepancies was a main objective in the judgement of the Trasga case. The third section studies the impact of enterprise groups in the contract of employment. We explain how there the contract isn’t with enterprise groups, but rather with the companies that integrate them. The employer here is always one of the group’s companies; although we might indeed find a situation of enterprise plurality inside the group. This is what happens when there is “unitary functioning of work organizations” and “confusion of staff” (on collective side) or “undifferentiated rendering of work” (on the individual side). These phenomena are analysed according to the new doctrine and are carefully distinguished from legal ways of circulation inside the enterprise group. Section four tackles the problems that enterprise groups raise in the area of productive decentralization, transfers, suspensions, modifications and succession. When it comes to productive decentralization what’s applied is article 42 of the ET. The transfer of workers within the group, on the other hand, is ruled by article 43 of the ET, although in the temporary posting of workers inside the group all sanctioning measures are excluded. In relation to substantial modifications of work conditions and suspensions, we must refer the reader to the section dedicated to collective dismissals; however, in this fourth section there is a quick comment about how in the assessment of economic causes one must take the group into account and how its dimension should be negotiated in the process (Supreme Court judgement 21.5.2015, appeal 231/2014 -Servicontrol case 1- and Supreme Court judgement 11.7.2018, appeal 9/2017 -Consenur case-). The fifth section is dedicated to economically caused dismissals inside the group. It especially analyses collective dismissals. There are three basic issues to study: 1º) who make the dismissals, 2º) who participates in the consultation phase, and 3º) how the causes of dismissal should be assessed, especially economic causes. We analyse jurisprudence about this matter and conclude that when the enterprise group is pathological, it’s the group itself that must make the dismissals; the negotiation commission must, in these cases, be only one, as if there were but one company, forming the labour representation according to the affected centres. In regard to the assessment of economic causes in enterprise groups, we must note that the company is the usual sphere of assessment. The exception, again, are pathological groups in plural enterprise positions: in these cases, the cause must be assessed in the sphere of the group. The next section centres around collective negotiation and strikes in the context of enterprise groups. Regarding collective negotiation, we comment the Supreme Court’s judgement 30.1.2018, appeal 9/2017 (Consenur case), that analyses an interesting problem of change in the application of the collective agreement, produced by enterprise succession. However, the subject that has raised the most problems in judicial practice is really the reach of striking rights within the enterprise group. This matter deserves, we think, to be examined with great attention. We therefore study the judgements of the cases of Pressprint, Vocento, Zeta group and Coca Cola Iberian Partners. Our study comes to its end examining the problems enterprise groups raise in judicial processes. We must warn that the group has no capacity to take part in them. Articles 16.5 and 80.1.b) of the LRJS (Social Jurisdiction Regulating Law) cannot be interpreted in any other way, despite the ambiguity of their literal wording. In any case, interpreting the contrary wouldn’t be a very practical solution: the group has no assets with which to take responsibility and condemning judgements could not be executed against the companies that integrate the group. Lawsuits shouldn’t, therefore, be directed against the group, but against the companies that are considered responsible. If what is pursued is the extension of responsibility inside the group, there will be voluntary passive joint litigation, since responsibility will be joint and several. In this case, the employee will be able to choose between directing the lawsuit against one, some or all of the companies involved. However, if the employee decides not to direct the lawsuit against all of them, it will not be possible to later execute the ruling against companies that were not mentioned in the enforceable title. To support this, we refer, in this section, to the Supreme Court’s judgement 18.3.2014 (appeal 114/2013). Later, we examine the procedural difficulties faced by the groups when it comes to declarations of insolvency. Finally, we finish off by analysing the position of the group in judicial processes and its relation to consultation periods. © 2019 Ministerio de Empleo y Seguridad Social","collective dismissal; enterprise group; insolvency procedure; judicial process; legal corporate; liability; Plural employer; strike; unitary direction","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139765890"

In this article, we aim to critically synthesize the available information about this law ten years after its sanction from an approach that takes into account environmental, economic and social aspects. In particular, we characterize the performance of this law in the Chaco Region in different dimensions, identify its main challenges and describe a series of proposals that from the science and technology sector can contribute to its (re)design and implementation in the context of the revisions of the Provincial Native Forest Land Use Planning Programs. In order to accomplish these objectives, we integrated information available from different sources, such as laws and regulations (national and provincial), scientific literature, reports from government agencies and NGOs and newspaper articles. The Forest Law installed in the public opinion of our country the problems related to the loss of native forests and has positioned itself as the main national instrument for forest conservation. Although deforestation rates lowered in the Chaco Region, there is no clear evidence that this reduction was due to its application. The Forest Law in the Chaco Region presents a series of challenges to improve its performance in terms of its effectiveness, equity and social legitimacy. In this paper, we present ten observations that emerge from the review carried out. On the other hand, linked to these observations, we outline a series of research and action proposals for enhancing the performance of the law. © 2018, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

The unequal distribution of rents and social groups in the urban core of Alicante occurs from the first urban plans, but the recent strong real estate development and the large number of homes executed has been part of the exacerbatedness of this inequality. Correlation of spatial data through covariance and cartographic analysis of differentiated urban subunits shows differentiated results within the level of competitiveness and intra-urban competition with an analogy to socio-economic variables. This process set by the location of the new residential spaces is an approximation to the struggle for land use within concepts in human ecology, with consequences for displacement, dominance, invasion-succession and assimilation-segregation of social groups and incomes. Despite recent attempts to in embryoze the situation through intervention in partial planning and the distribution of income towards new urban spaces has left other spaces where there is a process of socio-economic substitution, because of a situation of marked structural disadvantage. © 2020 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

It does so by assigning a numerical weight to each one. The intention is that public administrations grant better conditions to those organizations that best behave with society as a whole. To be able to take advantage of these conditions, an ECG organization should produce a balance of the common good using the matrix of the common good, whose function is to allow organizations to measure in their contribution to the well-being of society. The objective of this article is to present three models that permits flexibility in the weight that is initially granted to each of the five stakeholders, and therefore contribute to an ongoing conversation within the ECG community. The models embody three ways to represent the weight of each stakeholder, by analyzing the type of relationship that organization has with each of its stakeholders. In the case of suppliers, the model goes a step further, by estimating the weight of each of the stages that make up the supply chain. Design, Methodology, Approach In the case of each of the models, a dynamic measurement process is proposed, based on the circumstances of each organization at the time their situation is evaluated, which can be updated in each of the evaluation reviews that are carried out. The first methodology is based on quantifying the relationship established with each stakeholder based what the relationship costs in money, by measuring what each stakeholder contributes to the relationship in market prices. The other two methodologies are based on quantifying the relationship based on time, in the case of the second model, the working hours dedicated to the relationship, and in the case of the third model, these working hours adjusted to the environmental behavior of the organization. Methodology 1: The magnitude of market prices To measure the relative importance of each stakeholder for an organization, the market price is used in this methodology. For conventional economics, price in an ideal perfect market, without market failures, shows the level of efficiency in achieving balance of what is offered by producers and what is demanded by consumers (organizations and families). Adding the price that the organization pays or obtains from each stakeholder provides a global contribution that, according to market prices, is relative to the contribution by its stakeholders. With the price of each stakeholder as a percentage of the total, it will be possible to know, by means of a rule of three, their relative weight over the whole. Methodology 2: The magnitude of hours of work Without the work of people (present or past in the development of machinery), there are no products and therefore there is no economic activity. The time dedicated to this work expresses the portion of life dedicated to the relationship, a magnitude that puts the life of each person at the center of that relationship. Each stakeholder has more or less relation with other agents depending on the time contributed to each relationship. Material and service suppliers- both direct and further down the supply chain- provide time to facilitate the means of production to other organizations. Financial suppliers provide the time required to assess a proposal and grant a loan, or open a deposit. Each of these suppliers contributes to the good sold by the EGC organization the time of their workers in several senses- the time necessary to transform the intermediate goods, plus the time incorporated in the intermediate goods contributed by the suppliers, plus the time that the financial intermediaries have dedicated to manage the financing. In summary, each of the hours dedicated represent contributions of time, contributions of life from / to the different stakeholders. The contribution in time are hours of life that the organization which performs the balance receives and gives to its stakeholders and can be measured in working hours. Methodology 3: The magnitude of hours of work adjusted to the impact produced in the environment The environment that surrounds the organization devotes time to the organization and the organization corresponds to the environment to a greater or lesser extent. Conventional, neoclassical economics considers the economy as an isolated subsystem, self-sufficient, and considers that part of its study is environmental economics, where manufacturing, human and natural capital are substitutable, and the only unit of measurement is the price, which also incorporates measuring and paying for environmental externalities. Against this vision, the ecological economy argues that the whole is not the economy but the biosphere, and that the economy is only a subsystem of the social. The economy is within a natural framework that supports and enables its operation, and therefore the unit of measurement has to go beyond the price and provide for the measurement of physical units, within a global framework. The previous section while studying the hours of work, implicitly recognizes the participation of the other, through the percentage of their life dedicated to the organization, thereby breaking with a self-sufficient individualism which has conveniently forgotten that people need the means to live. Therefore, the centrality of each person's life must take into account, and give due importance, to the nature that sustains that life. The magnitude of ""environmentally adjusted hours of work"" corrects the magnitude of ""hours of work"" by collecting the deviations from the world average of how the economic activity of each organization affects water, land- including energy and materials- and the quality of the air. Results, Research Limitations From a rather inflexible ECG matrix in version 4.1, the newer version (version 5.0) has offered an important improvement in flexibility. The three methodologies presented of the article add depth to how that flexibility should be implemented, providing detailed proposals as well as a fresh perspective and underlying foundation. However, it is not without its limitations. Principally, it is worth considering whether the effort in terms of necessary calculation compensates for the added flexibility it brings to the matrix. Some of the data is easily available, such as the financial transactions of the organization (necessary for the first methodology), while the environmental ratios required for methodology three are also accessible and of increasingly high quality. For the second methodology, what is required is for the ECG organization to work more closely with its suppliers to garnish the information of time inputs. A second possible shortcoming is that methodologies 2 and 3 suppose some estimations, which could distort the results. However, there is a strong argument for saying that, since in any case the first link of the supply chain can be correctly determined, the result will always be better than for a uniform matrix. Therefore, it is considered that the added flexibility provided by the different methodologies more than compensates for the efforts required both in the collection of information and in the performance of calculations. Implications, Practical Conclusions and Originality The three methodologies presented improve substantially the balance of the common good, allowing the use of different magnitudes and the consideration of different degrees of flexibility to assess the relative weight of different stakeholders. In addition, the underlying philosophy of these methodologies is relevant not only for the economy of the common good, but also for those whose objective is a more equitable and fair distribution of the wealth generated in current production processes. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.; La Economía del Bien Común (EBC) propone medir el éxito de una organización en función de cómo trata en sus relaciones a sus distintos stakeholders: proveedores, financiadores, trabajadores, clientes y entorno social. La importancia o peso relativo de cada stakeholder en la organización variará con el tiempo, dependiendo de las circunstancias y prácticas que se lleven a cabo en cada momento concreto. Este artículo presenta tres metodologías para cuantificar este peso relativo de cada stakeholder en la organización. Cada metodología se fundamenta en una magnitud, o una unidad de medida de la relación stakeholder-organización, diferente. Estas magnitudes, que son precios de mercado, horas de trabajo, y horas de trabajo ajustadas medioambientalmente, son las que definen lo que significa ""aportar"" en la relación establecida entre la organización y el stakeholder. Para el precio de mercado la aportación viene definida por el coste de la relación y se mide en dinero; para las horas de trabajo la aportación es la parte de vida dedicada, aportada a la relación, y se mide en horas; las horas de trabajo ajustadas medioambientalmente ajusta las horas de trabajo mediante un corrector medioambiental.

Since the middle of the last century, public policies have provided incentives for plantations of trees and other crops, promoting deforestation. Remnant forests are degraded from exploitation of the principal commercial species in cutting cycles shorter than 20 years, and productivity of wood is now too low to be economically useful. Productivity can be improved through post-harvest management (e.g., cutting of bamboo and lianas), but on highly degraded sites more intensive management is needed, such as scarifying of soils or planting seedlings of high-value, fast-growing species to allow cutting cycles of around 30 years and increments greater than 3 m3.ha-1.year-1. Action is also needed to control illegal trade in native wood, which diminishes the prices and reduces the viability of socially and environmentally responsible enterprises. Moreover, sustainable management of the native forest should be accompanied by reductions in taxes, for example through payment for ecosystem services, or by other types of use, such as harvesting of non-timber forest products. In the case of small and medium property owners, governments and organizations should stimulate conservation of forest through forest resources and services use, actively encourage diversification of production, and offer tools that promote independence from intensive tobacco cultivation. Funding is needed both directly to producers (through laws) and to institutions that generate knowledge that permits concrete advances in sustainable forest management. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

These disasters can also damage the regional and national economy by interrupting the production cycle, reducing income, and creating unemployment and food shortages, among others. This study presents a method that evaluates the risk due to flooding in agricultural areas. The method proposed uses a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to obtain the parameters of the natural hazard, including the depth, duration, and velocity of the flood. Damage curves were constructed from data obtained by administered surveys to scientific, technical, and farming personnel, supplemented with bibliographic information. These curves considered the various stages of the vegetative crop cycle in such a way that by relating them to the probability estimate of an extreme flow occurring each month of the year, it was possible to calculate the expected damage associated with each magnitude of the extreme flows. The study area corresponds to the Champoton River basin in the state of Campeche, Mexico, where the duration of floods, which are slow, is more important than the velocity of the water. © 2018 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

The objective of this work is to demonstrate the technical viability of the electrification of the transport and decoupling sector of petroleum derivatives. As a result of a first strategic approach in this substitution, a reduction of 86.223,0 kbep of diesel of national consumption, would eliminate gasoline imports. Thus, by the year 2035, only about 19.650,99 kbep would be imported, destined for the consumption of commercial, residential and construction sectors. © 2020, Escuela Politecnica Nacional.

This responds to some shortcomings of the city, as the deficiency of public spaces in terms of quantity and quality, but it is also an expression of a logic of urban growth, intrinsically linked to the reproduction of capital and to financial liquidity. In this sense, it is that the present work aims to recover the conceptual proposal of the ""growth machine"", questioning its applicability to the case of mining cities, under the influence of an export boom. It does so by discussing the conceptual link between the momentum generated by the mining boom, the materialization of liquidity in real estate investment and the construction of public spaces. To illustrate this reflection, an exploratory analysis of the spatial-temporal distribution of building permits in Copiapó, and of certain elements of the discourse on public space projects, particularly Kaukari Park, is presented. The results illustrate how the discourses on this particular park are articulated with a premise of growth and it shows the orientation of building permits submitted by companies and specifically the real estate sector towards large infrastructure projects. It can be assumed that this produces economic benefits for certain agents, but a new centrality is also being built and the park project promises to meet some citizen demands. © 2018 Revista de Urbanismo.

This process was fostered by indigenous urban immigrants, specifically those living in the city's San Roque Neighborhood. Participants and context During the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American countries saw a wave of internal migration, which was characterized by the arrival of rural, peasant indigenous to large cities. Ecuador was no exception. Its two largest cities, Quito and Guayaquil, were the most popular points of arrival. In Quito, new residents met up in specific neighborhoods, particularly those located in the southern part of the city and in the Historic Old Town, where the both cost of land and rent were much lower. This population includes a very particular group: the indigenous, who quickly began to reproduce their traditional economic, cultural, political, and social practices in symbiosis with the urban way of life, becoming known as urbanite indigenous. This phenomenon was found throughout Latin America. Quito received settlers from the provinces of Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, and Imbabura, and one of the neighborhoods where they arrived was San Roque. Here, they carried out popular economic activities that helped them to obtain the resources they needed to survive in a new context. For example, they worked as bricklayers, baggers and loaders in marketplaces, restaurants, grocery stores, tailors, etc. They went on to create cooperatives, cash pools or community savings banks, and associations that helped them to guarantee the dignified living conditions they needed to ensure more than merely their survival, both for those who were already living in the city, as well as for newcomers from rural areas. Methodology This all led to the proposal of a methodological framework to better understand and interpret this transition from a popular economy to the popular and solidarity economy that we see today. We begin based on the premise that in order to research economic experiences that are a far cry from what the prevailing capitalist, business-centered economic system has established, we must first look at method- ologies are rarely used in economic issues. Then we can continue on to better understand the players involved, their subjectivities and intersubjectivities. Having established this framework, we undertook a qualitative methodological strategy, specifically, ethnography and case studies. The ethnography side involved four steps: 1) Observation and open participation in the daily life of the urbanite indigenous living in the San Roque Neighborhood in 2016 and during the first quarter of 2017. 2) Visits to several small businesses helped us to gain a better understanding of the neighborhood's social and economic organizations. In this step of the process, we had the support of researchers from the City Institute of the Municipality of Quito, who put us in contact with the San Roque neighborhood leaders. 3) Holding in-depth interviews and working with focus groups. We verbally requested permission to record interviews and take photographs. 4) Understanding and theoretical interpretation of the cases through the substantivist approach of the economy and the theoretical reflections of the popular economy and popular and solidarity economy. We also used an operative concept of indigenous urban immigrants. We chose three organizations for our case studies: a savings and loan cooperative, housing cooperative, and a savings bank. In applying this method, we considered the following elements: information and a diagnosis of the organization, activities, operations, and the presence of solidarity.We verified that the players in the popular economy moved to create an organization within the popular and solidarity economy, and saw how they implemented the principles of cooperatives, the popular and solidarity economy, and the concept of Good Living [a concept expressed in the native Kichwa language]. To collect information, we put together a matrix that covered the abovementioned points, including information resulting from ethnographic work that allowed us to find that the analyzed cases fulfill the parameters needed to be considered practices specific to the popular and solidarity economy. Results The information obtained from our research showed that urbanite indigenous immigrants in the San Roque Neighborhood created economic strategies to overcome their problems and satisfy their needs without turning to assistance from the state or the private sector. These strategies can be divided up into two major groups. The first was developed first back in 1970 and can be identified as one of a popular economy, in which, either individually or as families, they created grocery shops, small restaurants, bakeries, and a wide range of services in marketplaces. The second group can be called a popular and solidarity economy; it gained steam near the end of the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century. This is characterized by the principles of solidarity, participatory democracy, transparency, reciprocity, mutual assistance, etc., and is made up of cooperatives, associations, and cash pools. We found that in San Roque, a process took hold that transformed the popular economy into one reflecting more of a solidarity economy, without eliminating the first. However, these new economic strategies are unable to guarantee, in an associative sense of the word, material aspects such as access to jobs, savings, credit, housing, healthcare. Also, being something quite new, symbolic aspects that are the result of its community relationships that were initially developed in their native regions and are now being reproduced in a new territory: the city. These aspects include trust, community governance, collective work, and mutual assistance. Limitations of the research It is important to point out that minimal quantitative information is provided about the organizations we analyzed, and there is a reason for this. Our access was limited by actions taken by the Superintendent of the Popular and Solidarity Economy, in which a savings and loan cooperative was intervened by the government, leading to its closure. This caused the key players to have a certain level of distrust, and as a result, they did not allow us access to their minutes, records of deposits, loans, assets, etc., which were necessary for us to better understand aspects related to the administration, financial inclusion, or origin of the organizations. Practical conclusions and original value These results allowed us to reach the following practical conclusions: a) It is important not to homogenize indigenous groups, but rather differentiate them depending on their contexts in order to give visibility to a population group that lives in cities using economic practices that are different from the capitalist, business-based economies or public economies; b) The economic practices of urbanite immigrants in Quito should not be limited to the popular economy, as they have been reflected in several studies, since there is a more organized level of action, which is that of the popular and solidarity economy; c)We have included considerable information about the popular economy and the popular and solidarity economy of urbanite indigenous immigrants in the San Roque neighborhood in the case study, since local public policymakers need to understand the particularities of these groups in order to create policies that respond to their stakeholders' needs. This can also be of great use in proposing public policies that contribute to moving from merely a popular economy to more of a solidarity economy. The importance that this article is derived from its presentation of a population group that is found not only in Quito, but throughout Latin America. Thus, the work done here can contribute to comprehending the economies of that entire population. It is also important to point out that our focus was different from that of other work done on urbanite indigenous in the San Roque neighborhood, which have limited their analysis to the popular economy, effectively making other aspects of the economy, governed by solidarity, mutual assistance, and community governance, among others, absolutely invisible. To close, as mentioned above, this knowledge is indispensable to all levels of government to ensure that the state is able to create public policies that ensure it fulfills the 2008 constitutional mandate, which declares that Ecuador has a social and solidarity economy, and a subsystem of popular and solidarity economy. © 2012 Universitat de València.","Cooperatives; Economic anthropology; Immigrant; Organizations; Reciprocity; Social economics; Transition economies","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070750029"

Sherry wines have always had a special position in that trade, particularly from the second half of the eighteenth century, when wine sales began to increase gradually as a result of the transformation of traditional Sherry winery in modern winemaking agribusiness. On the contrary, is very little known the significant fact that Cadiz was also a remarkable vinicultural city from the mid-nineteenth century, and that between 1933 and 1964 it was part of the demarcation of the Sherry Wine Region: an interesting reality that we try to bring out in this study. Many industries related with wine commerce were set in the province in the XIX century. The trading port function of Cadiz regard to wine and the rise which took the wine industry in Jerez from the twenties of the nineteenth century induced many merchants to become winemakers. For instance, we can highlight the cases from Julián Pemartín or León de Argüeso, who became very famous wine merchants. In a context of continuous changes and transformations in the wine sector there had arisen many wine-houses in the city of Cádiz such as Manuel Moreno de Mora, J. Díaz Tezanos and Company, Viuda de X. Harmony and Company, Lacoste and Company, Guillermo Shaw and Company and Aranda and Cesteros. Especially significant was the activity developed by three aging cellars established by prominent merchant families: Lacave and Company, Miguel M. Gómez and Abarzuza and Company. They got a significant position in national and international markets and gave employment to many workers in the city, so they constituted one of the main bases of the town's economy. These three wineries offered a large variety of wines and among their products they included the following typical ones: Sherry Amontillado, Moscatel, Pedro Ximénez, Manzanilla, and some imitations of wines such as Port wine, Málaga or Madeira. One of the main features of these wineries was that any of them had vineyards in the city, but they bought grapes or wine to others producers in order to finish the production process and sell them later. The main competitive advantage of these houses was their strategic location, close to the sea and to the railway station, as they could make the shipment of their expeditions effectively, both by land and by sea. So the function of Cadiz as a city which elaborated Sherries and other wines, not just a commercial city of wines from Jerez, is demonstrated by the significant and lasting activity of that three wine-houses which were established in Cadiz for more than one hundred years, globally speaking. There were times of growth and expansion and others of crisis and economic recession, but these companies were able to overcome all the problems, strengthening their position in national and international markets over time. In addition, they were very important for the development and application of new technologies and production methods, as well as the installation of new means of transport in the city. Moreover, it should also be noted that Cadiz was part of the demarcation of the Sherry Wine Region from 1933 to 1964 thanks to these three wineries, a fact unknown for many people. The wines from this area were sold around the world and they were known for their great prestige and quality. Lacave and Company, Miguel M. Gómez S.A. and Abarzuza and Company enjoyed the benefits of the demarcation of the Sherry Wine Region and developed their activities under the protection of the Regulatory Council for over thirty years. But the case of Cadiz is different from the case of Bordeaux and Porto. The wines of the Medoc and other neighboring French wine regions are better known as ""Bordeaux"", and wines produced exclusively in the Douro Valley are known as ""port wine"". This has been due to the early vintner functions of Bordeaux and Porto. Following the initiative of the vintner Arnaud de Pontac in the sixties of the seventeenth century, aging large-scale New French Claret (name that gave the British to modern Bordeaux wine) began in stores that British merchants had in Chartrons (commercial district of the city located on the banks of the Garonne river), because they were who controlled the production and the trade of wines in the area. In the British Isles and in general, these wines were taking the name of ""Bordeaux"". In Porto, after an initial phase of preparation of their wines to the British consumers' tastes, the English merchants chose to control the quality in the origin in the mid-eighteenth century by setting up branches of their companies. In fact, the wineries were located in Vila Nova de Gaia, but the commercial importance of the second Portuguese city and the fact that businessmen resided there was the cause of the Douro wines raised in Vila Nova de Gaia were called ""Port wine"". Meanwhile, Cadiz was not a vintner centre until the second or third decades of the nineteenth century, as we have discussed above. During the modern centuries (XV to XVIII) the city of Cádiz was a commercial and financial centre for Sherry wines to the British Isles, the northern continental Europe, the Strait of Gibraltar and the Spanish colonies in America, as others towns in the area (El Puerto de Santa María, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Rota, Chiclana...). But in all this time there is no evidence that there were any aging wine activity in Cadiz: the functions of the city on this business line were commercial and financial transactions, and provision of vessels to board wines. Consequently, Cadiz did not name the wines of its region, unlike Bordeaux and Oporto. On the contrary, when the demarcation of the Sherry Wine Region was constituted in the thirties of the twentieth century, Cadiz was integrated in the breeding area (maximum category) with Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María. It was the official recognition of Cadiz as a vintner city.","Business; Cádiz; Grape and wine-growing; History; Viticulture; Wine","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039437558"

With regard to production technology, the agricultural sector maintained a high investment effort which, coupled with the accelerated decrease in labour, made it possible that the low rate of capital per worker was corrected. This investment effort also allowed the consolidation of a set of medium-sized professional holdings, still minority in number but already the productive core of the sector.

Successive reentries without considering the time needed for the ecosystem to recover led to a degradation and simplification of great proportion of the Southern Yungas, making these forests more susceptible to transformation to other land-uses. For this reason, an early adoption of guidelines for sustainable forest management, including the wide range of values that these forests provide (e.g., biodiversity and ecosystem services), is needed. Currently, guidelines to attain a sustainable yield of wood and decrease the negative effects of logging are available, and also a great amount of information has been developed to start delineating sustainable forest management guidelines for other values of the Southern Yungas forest. However, these guidelines have been mainly ignored in the Southern Yungas due to, in our opinion, primarily, a lack of a socio-economic and political scenario framed in a long-term forest policy is set. It is necessary to provide economic compensations that promote land-owners to shift to sustainable forest management activities. An alternative should be to recognize and pay for the diverse ecosystem services that the Southern Yungas provide. To implement sustainable forest management guidelines will ensure that these forests continue providing multiple goods and services that benefit local stakeholders which depend on the Southern Yungas. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

In spite of its economic potential, it has been the target of severe criticism, and has been pointed out as the cause of some environmental problems and, particularly, of affecting biodiversity. The objective of the research was to analyze a government resolution that limits the expansion of oil palm cultivation (CPA) in the South of Maracaibo Lake (SML, from the environmental, legal and socioeconomic points of view. Ecological sustainability indicators were estimated for a representative crop and a comparison was made with a plantain crop (male banana or Musa AAB Simmonds).

Nor were any scientific studies found to support the supposed proliferation of pests, nor was it possible to evidence the displacement of ""strategic items"" on which the instrument is based. The resolution in question does not comply with the public consultation stipulated in the environmental regulations and, since both crops negatively impact the environment, the expansion of banana cultivation should also be limited; otherwise it should be modified or annulled. The low biodiversity registered in oil palm cultivation is due to its agronomic management as a monoculture, but the loss of native biodiversity attributed by critics to the CPA is manifested when natural forest is eliminated for its establishment, which is not the case in the study area, where the crop is established on land previously used for livestock, so the application of this argument as legal support is incorrect. © 2019, Centro de Investigaciones Agroalimentarias (CIAAL).

Social vulnerability maps can be used to improve land use management and economic development. This paper presents a methodological proposal for elaborating a social vulnerability index at local level, using the statistical technique of principal component analysis in a geographic information system. As an advantage, this technique facilitates the weighting of indicators by decreasing the subjectivity of the process. The Argentine Republic was analyzed as an application case. Based on the variables included in the national census, 19 descriptive indicators were constructed, which were summarized in a single index that allowed the entire territory to be categorized at the level of census radio. The classification used was useful in discriminating against census stations with extreme conditions of social vulnerability. With some exceptions, greater social vulnerability was observed in the western and northern sectors of the country. In contrast, the Pampean and Patagonian region and the capital city of the country had the lowest rates. © 2018, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

In a seminal work, Ivanov and Webster (2007) came up with a methodology to measure the contribution of tourism to the economic growth that uses per capita GDP growth rate as an economic growth measure disaggregating it in the part generated by the touristic activities and that generated by other industries. Various authors have used the methodology suggested by Ivanov and Webster applying it to different countries. However, all of the works have considered as ""tourism"" what can be classified as the representative sector of this activity: hotels and restaurants. Currently, the development of the Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSA) have permitted to have a better accounting of the touristic activities in many countries, which leads to the need of new measures of the contribution that this sector has on economic growth. This work aims to measure the contribution that tourism has on economic growth by an expansion of the methodology suggested by Ivanov and Webster (2007) using TSA data for 2012- 2013. The expansion of this method allows the disaggregation of the touristic sector into its many characteristical branches and to measure the individual contribution that each of them has on the economic growth of Colombia, this with the purpose of observing in a more specific way the existing relationship between touristic activities and economic growth. The measurement results show that in 2013 Colombia grew 3,68%, of which 1,38% are directly related to the touristic sector. This result show clear evidence of the importance that the touristic sector has for the Colombian economy. Exploring the inside of the touristic sector, the characteristical branches that showed the most dynamism where food and beverages supply; ground transportation services and real estate services and housing rental, linking these activities 0,413%, 0,306% and 0,271% out of the 3.68% of Colombia's economic growth respectively, leading to conclude that these three branches of the sector were related the strongest to Colombia's growth process. On the other hand, the branches that provided the least to the economic growth where complementary services and auxiliary transport; associations and recreational services, cultural, sports and other non-market services; and, other non-characteristical products, linking only 0,074%, 0,057% y 0,005% of the total growth of the country. A result of special attention for this year is the obtained by the accommodation services since it is -along with the food and beverages- normally used as the proxy to measure the touristic activity. However the results show that this branch contributed negatively to the real economic growth of Colombia causing a reduction of -0,003% of the total growth which gives evidence that using the Hotels and Restaurants ""sector"" as a proxy variable of the touristic activity could considerably underestimate the direct effects that tourism has over the Colombian economy and, therefore, it could not to be the proper variable to measure the touristic activity of this country. This work, disaggregating into branches the contribution that the touristic sector has on Colombia's economic growth, has allowed a wider view of the already existing link between touristic activities and economic growth, an analysis that could help the authorities to formulate better touristic strategies that generate value chains with other productive sectors.","Economic impact of tourism; Tourism contribution to economic growth; Tourism economics; Tourism Satellite Accounts; Tourism statistics","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039424302"

The accounting exercise conducted in this study calculates the net benefit per hectare obtained from the direct use value (DUV) for different land use alternatives (timber, non-timber, livestock and agriculture); the indirect use value (IUV) related to carbon storage; and the non-use value (NUV) (existence value).

Traditional housing cooperatives have played the part of developer and builder in the Spanish housing market, in order to be able to offer lower cost housing to the members of said cooperatives, generally as its owners. Added to this, after the collapse of development and construction activity and profit-earning following the property bubble burst in 2008, another phenomenon of ""false cooperativism"" was generated, where former developing companies made instrumental use of this legal formula with a view to reducing the costs of the construction and development process. These cooperative modes are far removed from the principles of social economy and have nothing in common with other international models of housing cooperatives, which offer an alternative system to meet residential needs. Interesting references are to be found in Denmark, Germany, Sweden, the USA, Uruguay and Canada, among others. However, despite this model not having been introduced in our historic context, initiatives have recently emerged involving a ""new"" housing cooperative trend corresponding to another kind of tenancy: right of use or assignment of use. With this new emerging model, it could be possible to overcome the traditional property-rental binomial on the Spanish housing market. These initiatives are pioneer and innovative in the context of Spain, which is why they have been framed within the scope of social innovation in some recent research. Furthermore, owing, among other factors, to the strong connection of some of these initiatives to our society's problem of ageing and care management, it is a subject which is now also attracting growing interest from other disciplines, such as psychology, gender studies, social services and others. Several recent research projects are turning up highly interesting results; all necessary in a field practically unexplored until now. Emerging assignment of use cooperative initiatives often (but not necessarily) include a cohousing project. Within this new concept a series of types have been classified; depending on the age of the cooperative members, a difference can be made between senior cohousing and intergenerational cohousing. The study presented here shows the main results of a qualitative research project carried out between January and May 2016, in order to obtain deeper knowledge of these pioneer initiatives emerging in Spain in the field of assignment of use cooperative housing. To take a closer look at an emerging practice, the formation of right of use cooperatives, the decision was taken to use a qualitative analysis, considering that it is the experts and users who can provide most information on the characteristics, causes and processes of forming these cooperatives. The approach included a first stage of theoretical research on the state of the question, and a second stage involving a series of non-structured interviews with assignment of use cooperative experts and users between March and May 2016. In view of the widely differing profiles of the people interviewed, the decision was taken to use a non-structured interviewing methodology, given its more open and flexible nature, thanks to which we were able to maintain common questions for the experts and users, while being able to ask specific questions depending on their specialisation. Being a qualitative approximation to this type of housing tenancy, the objectives of the research were rather introductory and unexplored, and can be summed up as follows: to obtain deeper knowledge of right of use cooperatives and cohousing, their categories and profile types; how the projects are set in motion, the process methodology; models of relationship between right of use cooperatives and cohousing, obstacles and successes of real projects; funding and economic aspects; eco-housing, more sustainable models. Outstanding among the results obtained, in first place is the fact that assignment of use housing cooperatives generally, but not necessarily, entail a cohousing or collaborative housing project. Collaborative or cohousing initiatives involve living with other people and assignment of use cooperatives are a legal tool which can serve to carry out that purpose. They can occur together, and, in fact, this legal formula represents for most of the people interviewed the most adequate formula for being able to launch a collaborative housing initiative in Spain. However, cases have also been found where a cohousing project uses other, more generic legal formulas, such as traditional associations or cooperatives (due either to lack of knowledge or to the actual size of the project). Lastly, there may also be cases of instrumental use of the ""assignment of use"" concept, which use the legal tool with the aim of obtaining improved economic conditions (without constructing a collaborative housing project). Between the two types of cohousing projects, senior cohousing initiatives enjoy greater success rates in Spain (distinguished from the intergenerational nature of the original cohousing experiences at international level). The fact that intergenerational initiatives experience higher failure rates is due to different factors, mainly of an economic-cultural or cultural nature. In general terms, one of the main stumbling blocks of these projects is the financing of intergenerational initiatives (only supported by ethical banking). In many cases, the minimum income required by financial institutions to grant loans can represent an obstacle impossible to overcome. The difficulty of finding the plot of land on which to set the project in motion is another of the major stumbling blocks. Involvement of the regional and local institutions in overcoming these difficulties could increase the number of successfully developed projects. Another of the major difficulties is the change of mentality implied by these cooperative projects in a society like the Spanish one, where owning a home has been the backbone of the family patrimony. The change towards new forms of housing tenancy means that these projects do not always end in success. In fact, this factor limits the interest of a certain part of society with sufficient economic resources to take out a mortgage in traditional terms. On the other hand, participatory methods and a non-hierarchical structure, added to selfmanagement and community-oriented design are an essential part of all cohousing projects analysed. Likewise, open architecture and participatory design (i.e. where the members of these projects actively participate in designing the private and common spaces), and reservation of the more privileged spaces for common use are features shared by all of the projects analysed. Concern for the environment and ecology is also highly present in the essence and development of these alternative living projects (eco-housing).

Normally, and to avoid confusing the situation between emigrants and expatriates, this concept is restricted to those who are temporarily or permanently displaced remaining in force the labor relation. An all-encompassing definition of all situations in which workers move or move abroad in the framework of an employment contract. With this frame of reference, the following analysis exposes the difficulties of both -the company and the worker- to meet certain obligations and to see the guaranteed rights fulfilled when the employment relationship developed abroad. Especially, measures to prevent extraterritorial labor risks and international social protection. Two subjects relatively resolved in Europe but not in the international level. For all the circumstances exposed in the study there converge the normative valuation, an exhaustive analysis jurisprudence, the administrative consideration or of internal managerial regulation and the composition doctrine of a matter still for developing. The study analyzes the difficulties to define the concept of expatriate. At first, there are included those workers who support his nationality and the link with the company of his native land while they develop his activity in the country of destination. However, it is increasingly common to extend this concept to any foreign worker -even having lost the link with their company of origin- and to incorporate those assumptions of work provided to a plurality of businessmen - contractors, subcontractors, assignments, transmissions or groups of company- with a foreign element and with constant demand for the provision of services in a foreign country or for a subsidiary or subcontracted company abroad. With the crisis, the profile has been modified; and of treating itself about workers whom the multinational companies were destining with unsurpassable working conditions and wage to giving services abroad only, now the reality of the expatriate includes also to whom - young, women, normally - decide to accept precarious conditions or to look for employments with working conditions abnormally disadvantageous in foreign countries. Therefore, it will be necessary to distinguish between the displaced expatriate and the non-displaced expatriate. However, in the latter case, the phenomenon that best describes the situation is that of emigration and, within the European Union, the free movement of people. To avoid the social dumping, the European legislator tries to intensify the cross-border control of the labor international mobility with recent regulation in this respect. For your part, Spain and in absence of a juridical own regime, the workers' displacement abroad has been assumed by the sociolabor reality, and specially by the judicial doctrine, as a supposition of displacement, considering that inside the same one incorporate so much the suppositions in which the destination is in Spain as abroad. Definitively, the labor norm allows to extend the protection of legal system. Nevertheless, and even guaranteed the application of the European norm, the obligations of prevention in labor health and the guarantees of coverage in National Health Service are not situated exempt from applicative problems in case of the expatriates. In the first case, because the company will have to know the place where the labor activity will develop in order to evaluate the risks, provide training and information to the worker, develop a personalized program of health surveillance of the same, facilitate the corresponding vaccination, warn and prevent from the risks not only labor but social of the country of destination, to foresee on the alterations by natural phenomena that will no longer be force majeure but regular situation, in its case, in said country or, finally, to intensify the forecasts for possible risks psychosocial in the adaptation to personal and family to a different environment. With regard to Social Security, the study highlights not only the possibilities of maintaining the registration and contribution to the country of origin despite the obligation to do so also in the country of destination, but the difficulties that certain benefits pose. Thus, mainly, healthcare - with public coverage and the usual complementarity of private insurance for assistance abroad - and work accidents or diseases (common, professional or work) developed in this environment, usually classified as accidents in mission, but over which there is a casuistic jurisprudence that does not always admit that everything that happens in these displacements has to be interpreted as something happened during the time and place of work. In conclusion, the analysis developed in this study shows that there is still, despite the social and economic importance of a growing business and labor phenomenon, a broad spectrum of legal action in relation to expatriates. For the present time, the interest has centred on fixing procedural or substantive procedure on relation to the applicable law or to the forum of judicial competition, without disregarding own questions of the contract of work as for the «exportability» both of the rights and of the labor obligations. But the difficulties increase when it is a question of guaranteeing both the prevention of his labor risks and the coverage of his social protection. And not so much because the regulations - especially Social Security and health care- have no experience in integrating a contingency with a foreign element but because, sometimes, the employment contract is governed by national regulations but worker protection has to be provided, necessarily, in the country of destination or, necessarily, with the intervention of both the country of origin and the country of destination. In fact, sometimes, the terminology itself is conditioned by these data, reserving the expression of «expatriate» for the worker who has to unsubscribe in the Social Security system of origin to proceed to the registration in the destination. More, sometimes, it is not easy to foresee the possible risks for the company to maximize the protection of the worker, nor does social coverage norms satisfy the interests of the latter, since European regulations or bilateral or multilateral agreements provide a sound basis -although not always enough-guarantee. Consequently, this constitutes a delicate and sensitive matter that would require greater -and better- intervention by the legislator in a transnational, globalized and relocated labor world in permanent and forced change. © 2019 Ministerio de Empleo y Seguridad Social.

In this manner, it was possible to identify the metropolitan ecological structure of said SES in order to establish a baseline from which its level of conservation or fragmentation can be identified in the future. The application of the methodology required the use of mixed research methods. In this regard, i) the SES area was defined from the combination of urban-functional and ecological-biophysical criteria; ii) criteria were defined to establish the unit of analysis and the land cover classification of the defined area at 1:25,000 scale; and iii) the assessment of ES was made based on a consultation with experts from academic, administrative and scientific institutions about the capacity to supply and demand ES present in the land covers that make up the SES. It was found that the metropolitan ecological structure is composed of ten natural and semi-natural land covers, which have the capacity to provide cultural ES (high level), regulation ES (high and medium levels) and supply ES (low level). In addition, as expected, the perception was validated that the flat area of the SES–which concentrates productive, economic and service activities–is clearly the demanding one, while the areas located in the periphery–i.e. piedmonts and the Eastern and Western mountain chains–are the suppliers. Finally, the results of this research once again demonstrate that, from the academic angle, there are novel ways to strengthen the processes of formulating guidelines for planning and environmental management of metropolitan SES, from the combination of spatial analysis and expert knowledge. © Universidad de La Rioja.","Built metropolitan structure; Cali; Ecosystem services; Metropolitan ecological structure; Socioecological system","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090874211"

The differences and economic effects of updating drinking water service rates with NCPI respect NPPI were highlighted; the main theoretical properties of each of these indices were compared; it was emphasized that NCPI is not designed to capture the variation in production costs required by the operator organism; the index is a national average and therefore does not reflect regional or state differences, let alone municipal differences; drinking water service is part of the weightier of that index, hence the increase in service tariffs contributes to rising inflation and, overestimates inflation by about 1% per year, because methodologically cannot include the replacement effect of new goods or quality increases in goods and services.

The effectiveness of management and planning depends to a large extent on the ability to transform the human behaviors that most influence the state of ecosystems and landscapes. Therefore, the capacity of research processes and results in ecology to transform the reality of territories can be enhanced by its integration with conceptual and methodological elements of the human behavioral sciences. In the territory, changes in land use and land cover are the result of a multiplicity of decisions made by those individuals that affect and benefit from ecosystems, mostly farmers. This paper reviews theories, concepts, methods and applications of social psychology to make visible and discuss their real and potential contributions to the research and management of rural ecosystems and landscapes subject to transformation by agriculture, which are illustrated by studies in the Argentine Dry Chaco. The Theory of Planned Behavior proved to be a conceptual and analytical model of great synoptic value to understand the endogenous motivational factors that influence the formation of intentions to conserve remnant forests by agricultural producers. The social valuation of ecosystem services made it possible to observe the diversity of identities and valuation profiles that coexist in the territory. Finally, overlapping trade-off and indifference curves proved to be a simple and powerful tool for linking ecological and preference trade-offs, and for identifying barriers and opportunities for farmers to transition to land use systems that are both biophysically efficient and socially acceptable. © 2018, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

This situation does not change significantly until neoliberalism, which has marked the game rules in economic relationships since the Wall Street Crash of 1929, has raised serious doubts about whether the capitalist system in its purest expression is able to make an efficient allocation of resources, and in a sustainable manner. It seems that the answer must be negative if we consider that such doctrine is to a great extent direct cause of the crisis of 2007. This makes social economy become more and more important as a way to understand relationships between suppliers and demanders, adopting a variety of forms, responding to the challenges of the market and using new tools, placing itself on its own right as a third option between the state and companies with the aim to maximise the benefit of the private sector (Chaves and Monzón, 2018). In this sense, collaborative economy is one of the new ways which social economy adopts (along circular economy, social innovation or economy for the common good, among others), maximizing property and underused goods whose owners decide to share temporarily with other people as to enable their maximum use, substituting the idea of consuming for the sake of using, acquisitions for rental. The growth of information technologies has generated an exponential expansion of this type of economy, as illustrated by the figures recorded in this work, which has converted an anecdotal issue due to its small economic weight into a phenomenon which leads to a strong collision with traditional market operators in the different areas in which it operates. This paper aims to observe how the aforementioned collaborative economy has evolved until the present day, with a particular emphasis on what can be considered the biggest problem it must currently face, which is to achieve a balance between the companies being in the scope of this paradigm and the traditional entities which have operated in said areas until now and consider their interests damaged. In order to do this, an analysis of the literature which addresses the subject matter is initially carried out. The youth this collaborative economy still presents can be inferred from said literature, as it has not even got one single term it can be referred to. Because of that, its main characteristics are analysed, and those properties should serve to circumscribe what can be considered within its field of study, regardless of the term used. Its main advantages and disadvantages are examined theoretically and practically below. The advantages which collaborative economy offers, at least in their theoretical conceptualisation, are of all types: economic, since the surplus of resources is used (Sundararajan, 2014); also, this kind of consumption creates an improvement in the satisfaction of the consumer's necessities, which is possible thanks to a further extension of supply for consumers, the development of microenterprises, a quality improvement in the services, the savings that it entails and a drop in prices, among other benefits (Malhotra and Alstyne, 2014). It offers environmental benefits too, as it allocates resources more efficiently and also because the model itself entails a departure from traditional consumerism and it attempts to satisfy needs in a sustainable manner. Lastly, the social benefits are also evident, creating potential new jobs, new ways to create social ties, a broader supply and lower prices. The main challenge which requires a solution in order to achieve a peaceful coexistence with traditional companies is to develop a regulation which satisfies both parties. It seems that traditional operators, seeing the risk of losing significant market shares in what was a closed market until now, have organised themselves to pressure public authorities, justifying their claims by arguing that some of the organisations which operate inside collaborative economy are taking advantage of the benefits it offers with the aim to obtain larger profits, since it is not necessary to meet certain transaction costs associated with these activities: more restrictive regulations which entail higher administrative costs, a stable workforce and so forth, without mentioning the tax compliances they should face in case the sector is more controlled administratively. In this respect, the European Union has made significant efforts to provide basic notions which allow the establishment of an appropriate legal framework for said companies by the Member States, so that they can discern whether companies genuinely pertain to collaborative economy or they are mere operators which use their advantages for profit reasons. Principally, such criterion must be based on the professionalisation of the activity performed, either offering a good or a service; for this purpose, several criteria can be used, such as the regularity with which said activity is carried out, the benefits obtained over a given time period. Consideration can also be given to the number of necessary permanent employees to maintain the commercial activity operated, or, finally, the number of goods or services offered (amount of houses offered for tourist accommodation; number of vehicles in the case of public transportation, and so forth). The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) delivered a judgment on the Uber case concluding that, while it is true that it is a platform of a digital nature, it provides transport services and, as such, it must comply with the same requirements as other members in the same sector (taxi drivers). Although that judgment has not got binding effects, the Spanish Supreme Court has already implemented this resolution in similar cases, and it can therefore be considered that the opinion held by the high European tribunal can be supported by law. What seemed to be a solution that would allow sufficient time for Spanish lawmakers to refine the regulatory framework does not appear to satisfy the taxi trade, which continues to demonstrate (in Spain as well as in Portugal in October, 2018) because the option Uber and Cabify, to name the biggest companies, chose (requiring drivers to operate with a VTC license for rental vehicles with driver) is still considered to be unfair competition, despite the restriction of 1 VTC license for every 30 taxi licenses granted. However, the figures which form part of the presented paper leave no room for doubt: collaborative economy is progressively and significantly taking deeper and deeper root among consumers. That and the defense of these new exchange systems by the European Union compel public regulators to make an effort to resolve the coexistence of both systems. What remains to be seen is it being done with sufficient urgency, while respecting the principles of justification and proportionality when drafting the regulation which must be applied in the case of this new economic paradigm, without collaborative economy being constrained by unnecessary requirements which prevent its development to benefit all. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.; La denominada economía colaborativa está instalándose paulatinamente en la sociedad como un nuevo modelo económico, social, cultural e inclusive legal, fomentado por un cambio en múltiples valores y por las nefastas consecuencias de la crisis económica.

The most widespread idea among the latter is that it can be a viable alternative for solving social problems, because it seems that they can offer solutions to problems that neither government policy nor the market have been able to solve. Despite this, research on social innovation in academia is still scarce and it largely focusses on the analysis of case studies. Besides having a definition, it is essential to know the factors that brought about its materialization, as well as the process leading to its consolidation and spread. With a view to identifying, making visible and disseminating good practice, and also reflecting on the concept, the project of the social innovation map for the city of Valencia was raised, as a result of the collaboration between the University of Valencia and Las Naves Foundation of Valencia City Council. The city of Valencia is one of the large Spanish cities that has suffered most intensely the effects of the recent economic crisis, due to the immense importance that the real estate sector and lesser technological activities had acquired in previous years. Economic regression has had important social effects, giving rise to an extremely augmented and increasingly polarised urban space. In this context, the aim of the project is to learn about the social innovation initiatives that exist in the city of Valencia, their type and origin, as well as to understand and analyse the specific social scenario in which they are developing. METHODOLOGY Qualitative and quantitative techniques have been applied alongside each other in the study, working mainly on two lines of research. The first focused on analysing the concept of innovation, with the aim of defining common criteria which would allow us to select and characterise the initiatives. The techniques applied to this end have been: (1) documentary research, (2) conducting an online consultative survey of 51 university professionals from different disciplines on the most important aspects of social innovation, and (3) holding a focus group with experts on the matter from both academic and professional spheres. The second line of work consisted in gathering and analysing case studies in the city of Valencia. Given that there was no existing information, local calls for projects were consulted, as well as trawling through social networks, webs and various documentary sources. This initial enquiry enabled us to register a total of 112 initiatives, which, after filtering these, were reduced to 79, classified in seven categories depending on their main objective. Their geographical location in the urban environment allowed us to deduce some important aspects of the environment in which they arose. RESULTS Contributions to the definition and use of the concept Social innovation is a term that has many and varied interpretations. As common aspects, the experts taking part in the focus-group pointed to the following elements: - It is preferable to talk about sociocultural innovation, because there is not a single social process that is not at the same time cultural; if there is no cultural change, there can hardly be any social innovation. - Social innovation requires creativity, which brings with it the following elements: originality, adaptation, a future-oriented approach and the ability to solve social problems. However, the criterion of originality opens up a debate between, on the one hand, opinions based on the definition of social innovation according to Stanford Social Innovation, and on the other, those who support the definition of María Elisa Bernal, based on the experiences of UNECLAC. This latter proposes that social innovation involves new ways of doing traditional jobs, and that these jobs must be replicable in different contexts, so that the novelty is not as important as it is for the experts at the University of Stanford. - Another point of agreement is the role of the Administration. Although this acts as a source of different processes for social innovation, there are administrative structures which often inhibit initiatives being taken, and which still continue to promote standardised and unidirectional responses to complex multi-dimensional problems. There is a lack of dialogue, collaboration, synergy and confusion among the different agents promoting Social Innovation. Innovation in the public sphere is too limited to certain environments and restricted by its own economic, organisational and relational structure. Moreover, the results of the surveys of university teachers show us the conceptual differences arising from the various disciplinary perspectives. So while economists and sociologists give great importance to social challenges, geographers, historians and healthcare professionals consider aspects relating to community development important. However, within these two groups there are also differences: On the one hand, while geographers and historians attach no importance to putting the idea into practice, this for doctors is one of the most significant aspects. On the other hand, economists highlight novelty, whilst sociologists do not. Type of initiatives found, geographical location and relations with districts The 79 initiatives identified have been grouped into seven categories organised according to the aim of the innovation in each of them, the category 'Social dynamics and inclusion' being the one that groups the largest number of initiatives (24% of the total), followed by the one called 'Exchange and collaborative economy networks' (19%). In all of them the Third Sector predominates over other organisational forms such as self-organisation and the private and, above all, public sectors. The date initiatives started shows a significant upturn as of 2013, which can be related to the socio-political context at the time. Concerning the factors that propitiated their appearance, the results show that this is closely linked with the socio-demographic, economic and territorial conditions of the environment in which they appear. The innovative initiatives identified are concentrated in three main urban areas: 1) the district of Ciutat Vella and the neighbouring district of El Botànic; 2) Benimaclet, and the neighbouring districts of Algirós and Rascanya, and 3) Els Poblats Marítim. Although it is evident that we find ourselves facing complex social processes in which different variables intervene, and whose interpretation cannot be made except after a detailed qualitative analysis, this location points to the importance of the following variables: a) Firstly, the existence of initiatives seems to be related to the income level of the population. Literature on social innovation considers that this arises as a means of combatting social exclusion and enhancing the quality of life; this would explain the practical absence of these types of projects in districts inhabited by populations with a high income and the absence of conflicts relating to multiculturalism. b) However, the income variable is an insufficient explanation, since the most active hubs of social innovation do not necessarily match with the worst situation. Therefore, a second explanatory variable points to the link with social and citizen movements, in our case with the ""indignant"" movement, which had particular impact on the city of Valencia. The date on which they arose indicates this (65% of the ones detected grew up between 2014 and 2016) and their intensity in the districts which presented a larger percentage of votes for parties related to this movement in the 2015 local elections. c) But perhaps the most important variable is the social and associative fabric, the networks and the social capital consolidated over time. Thus, the three main innovation nuclei coincide with areas with a long tradition of formal or informal sociability, important associative hubs, linked to a powerful neighbourhood movement, an exceptionally dense festive framework, and different types of recreational or cultural associations; social networks which have been set up in response to a situation of prolonged marginalization and to territorial and social conflicts that have affected them. CONCLUSIONS The results of the research conducted enables us to conclude that, although there is a coincidence between the various specialists when pointing to the main aspects of social innovation as cultural change, creativity, adaptation, looking to the future and problem-solving ability, there are also marked differences arising from the different level of familiarity with the concept, and diverse disciplinary perspectives. In this respect, a significant point of agreement is the limited role of the Administration which, although it occasionally acts as a source of different social innovation processes, presents administrative structures which inhibit taking initiatives and continue to promote standardized and unidirectional responses to complex and multi-dimensional problems. Moreover, the empirical analysis has enabled us to point to the importance of geographical conditions (socio-demographical, economic and territorial) in the emergence of these initiatives. Among these conditions, the poor socio-economic situation must be highlighted, but also, and decisively, the link to social and citizen movements, and the existence of social networks and the social capital consolidated over time.","Neighbourhoods; Social innovation; Urban crisis; Valencia","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040698912"

It is a concept that firstly was applied at microeconomic level. However, its definition is not clear when it is applied to regions and countries. Therefore, its clarification is imperative in order to measure it at regional level and establish meaningful comparisons. One of the key approaches to the study of competitiveness is the World Economic Forum. This institution began developing the Global Competitiveness Index in 2004. Their methodology, with an important contribution of Sala i Martin and his team, is centered in identifying the pillars of competitiveness and the key variables in each of the pillar. Their aim is to obtain a more complete picture of the real development of the competitiveness of an economy, disaggregated into a comprehensive set of components that properly quantify this development. This makes it possible to know the situation and the evolution of global competitiveness. In this study the methodology is adapted for the 17 Spanish regions selecting 15 pillars: Business culture, Regional concentration/specialization, Internationalization, Innovation, Favorable industrial environment, Availability of capital, Institutional factors, Labor availability, Highly qualified workforce, Entrepreneurs and managers qualifications, Post-educational level, Knowledge infrastructures, Traditional basic infrastructures, Technological infrastructures and Region image. Business culture pillar consists of two basic indicators: the existence of barriers to entry and exit and the existence of risk culture. Each is analyzed through two variables. The existence of barriers to enter and exit is approximated by the tax burden on companies, which is a significant barrier to entry for companies and regulations. The second indicator is studied through two variables: the rate of entrepreneurial activity and the number of self-employed. Regional concentration/specialization is analyzed through four indicators: the concentration of production by sectors, the concentration of employment by sectors, the importance of high value-added activities, and the contribution of advanced services in the GDP. Internationalization is analyzed using three indicators: The share of exports in total regional GDP, the percentage of foreign direct investment in regional GDP and the new businesses created in the year divided into the population, as new firms tend to export a greater extent than older ones with the same size. Innovation is quantified through four indicators per population: registered patents, total expenditure on R&D, private spending on R&D, and expenditure on technological innovation. A favorable industrial environment allows the existence of a dynamic network of small and medium enterprises, as well as a low level of unemployment. To measure this pillar, the existence of SMEs is studied in two complementary ways; first the percentage of microSMEs (1 to 10 employees) and the percentage of medium-sized companies (50-250 employees). The first group has a size too small to optimize processes and thus must be considered a negative indicator of a favorable industrial environment, since in many cases they lack access to finance. By contrast, companies between 50 and 250 workers have a sufficient size to be able to export, improve the value chain, innovate and specialize. Additionally, the number of strikes and number of lost working days per year are studied. The availability of capital is measured through two variables: the savings as a percentage of regional GDP and the gross fixed capital formation in the region. Institutional factors are analyzed with three different variables: regional and local expenditure per capita, the crime rate, and cultural facilities such as the number of golf courses, cinemas and theaters per number of inhabitants. Labor availability is measured with the variation of the working population each year, the number of public vocational training centers, and the annual change in the number of foreign employees. Highly qualified labor force is studied with three indicators: The level of training of workers as the percentage of employed persons with secondary or tertiary education, the apparent labor productivity as the ratio of the regional GDP into the number of employees, and the number of university students as a percentage of the population. The pillar of qualification of entrepreneurs and manager is analyzed by two indicators: The level of professionalism and the level of efficiency. The first one can be measured by the percentage of entrepreneurs and managers of the total employees, while the ratio of GDP into the number of entrepreneurs and managers can be used to measure the level of efficiency. The post-educational level is studied through the analysis of two variables that provide insight into people who have completed non-compulsory education: the percentage of population with a university degree or a vocational training degree. The knowledge infrastructures included in the analysis are universities and R&D centers. They can be counted, but due to the great disparity in size is preferable to analyze homogeneous variables such as the spending on university education and number of full-time equivalent employees in R&D departments. Transport and communications infrastructures are essential for a competitive region. Kilometers of both roads and highways, airport activity (passenger traffic and freight transport) and the passenger numbers of middle- and long-distance trains are included in this pillar. Technological infrastructure is studied from the perspective of businesses and households through the calculation of the following indicators: percentage of companies with a website, companies using web-based services to communicate with public administrations, companies that sell their products or services on the internet and companies that have a local area network. Technological infrastructures of individuals and households are measured with the percentage of households with broadband internet access, percentage of the population who frequently use the internet, who contact electronically with public administrations and who buy often through websites. The last pillar is region image. Its focus is diverse in order to capture a number of very different dimensions. The indicators related to education are the number of students per teacher and the ratio of classrooms per student. The number of medium-sized cities, which according to the OECD definition correspond to municipalities between 100,000 to 250,000 inhabitants, is also an indicator of a good quality of life. Affordable housing price is also taken into account. It is measured by the number of real estate transactions divided by the population. In addition, natural conditions are a factor to consider, because more attractive regions typically have a higher number of hours of sunshine per year, more kilometers of coastline and lower annual rainfall. Finally, health related variables such as the number of hospitals, hospital beds and doctors per capita are computed in this pillar. Each of the pillars is included in one of the three environments that incorporate information about the level of competitiveness: productive environment (pillars 1 to 7), human capital environment (pillars 8 to 11) and public capital environment (pillars 12 to 15). In each pillar there are a set of variables that allow measuring the annual value of the pillar index. These indexes take values between zero and one. A higher value represents a higher level of competitiveness. With the averages of the pillar indexes we compute the indexes of the three environments. In turn, the aggregate index of regional competitiveness is the average of the three indexes of the environments. In a second stage, we perform a factor analysis in order to arrive to the improved index of regional competitiveness. This new index does not present important differences with respect to the order of regions. We also develop a cluster analysis to identify the groups of regions according to their competitiveness level. In the period 2001-2014 there are no significant changes in the index of competitiveness for any region. Therefore, Madrid is the most competitive region in all the years analyzed. The Basque Country, Navarra and Catalonia are also competitive regions and their high competitiveness level is similar. Aragon and La Rioja have less competitiveness but are in a better position than the group that includes most of the Spanish regions. Finally, the three least competitive regions are Canarias, Castile la-Mancha and Extremadura.","Competitiveness; Human capital environment; Production environment; Public capital environment; Regional competitiveness","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039416393"

Soils, water, and vegetation were sampled from six different traditional irrigation channels in the province of Granada, Spain. In general, the soils presented moderate-high values of organic matter, sandy-loam textures, high cation exchange capacity and basic pH. There were local differences, given by the original substrates (concentrations of carbonates, clay and Mg+2, Na+ and K+) or by the species present (organic matter and nitrogen). The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), indicated that the measured variables explained 39.2% of the sample variability, the most important variable being the concentration of carbonates, as for the rest, most of it is thought to be explained by the differences in management. Species abundance and richness seemed to benefit from competition-limiting factors, with the diversity index being inversely proportional to carbonates. Several species of agro-economic importance and wild crop relatives were inventoried that in addition to the generation of soil and carbon sequestration denote the key role of the acequias for the maintenance of the trophic nets and the durability of the agrarian systems. © 2019 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre.

Agricultural manufacturing must provide more than industrialization, that is, generate a value framework that protects the land while in its production process responds to interest groups. However, it is observed that the organizational dynamics of these companies have focused on the development of production, marketing and competitiveness strategies to dominate the markets. On the other hand, there has also been a cycle of accelerated changes and crises in the dominant economic models, creating new demands and requirements for companies, giving rise to concerns centered on ethical aspects. It is in this scenario where social responsibility emerges as a proposal of differentiated management to be voluntary and establish a company-society relationship beyond the legal, focusing on the company recognizing its double act of both, acceptance and negation, that is to say, accepts to promote the social good and refuses to do harm. Even though corporate social responsibility has had great importance since the 80s and 90s it is until the year 2000 that it becomes a global phenomenon being in constant transformation of conceptualization from the neoliberal economic perspective, generating a controversy in the roles of the private sector, government and nonprofit organizations. Corporate social responsibility refers to reconcile the economic interest of companies with social requirements, it has to do with the commitment that organizations must assume and not only with what they want to do, it is socially responsible to the extent that they incorporate human rights, transparency, corporate governance, ethics, environment, philanthropic activities, social investment and good acting with its stakeholders. Companies need a healthy society that in turn has companies in balance, so that the basis of corporate social responsibility is established on three axes: fair and balanced economy, promotion of ethical and social values and protection of the environment; likewise, it must take into account the interested parties in the business activities that are carried out, as the Nobel Prize for Economics Jean Tirole says: ""the company must provide protection to interested parties that do not control the decision process"". This social perspective basically aims to put ethics into action, starting from the understanding company's responsability with society to take voluntary measures that lead to an improvement in the quality of life of the actors involved. Situation that is accompanied by challenges that lead to a correlation of the academic field with business and social. Taking as a starting point the application of social responsibility for ethical performance and that is assumed voluntarily and not as an imposed action, it has been proposed to study how to advance in the social transformation in agricultural manufacturing, for which exposes an analysis of social responsibility in a case study, considering that this methodological premise has a high descriptive content that allows to show the complexities of the same and arrive at an approach of the explanations in terms of how the events happen and why. The notion taken up for this study of social responsibility is based on corporate citizenship, which indicates that the company must not only have responsibilities with stakeholders and shareholders but must act as a citizen who has obligations and rights. The Boston College proposal for corporate citizenship is used as an analysis model, which establishes that social responsibility is the way in which the company complies with its ethical and fundamental values through the minimization of damage and maximization of the benefit by responding to the parties interested and generating a solid financial result. Among the retaken constructs are the four theories of social responsibilities: corporate citizen theory (CCT), corporate social performance theory (CSD), shareholder value theory (TVA) and stakeholder theory (TAI). These theories have different approaches that go from the perspective that the company's social responsibility is only to achieve economic benefits and its commitment is only with the shareholders (TVA), up to retake the theory of corporate citizenship (TCC) in which considers that the organization has rights and obligations towards society, which is the most relevant in this investigation. The theories mentioned above are related to the dimensions proposed by Boston College: concept of corporate citizenship, strategic initiative, leadership, structure, social issues, relationship with stakeholders and transparency. The case study is conducted in Equipos Agricolas RA, which is a company with 40 years on the agricultural manufacturing sector and whose main activity is the design and manufacture of agricultural equipment for planting and harvesting potatoes. It was identified that the company is in a period of recognition of corporate social responsibility, is currently stable in the production of employment and economic benefits, it has more than 120 workers and its staff turnover is minimal. In relation to the model of corporate citizenship it is located in the initial stage, called elementary, in which the social recognition of its impacts on the environment comes to the generation of employment, payment of taxes and the sale of effective products for planting and potato harvest. This represents the challenge of the capacity for innovation to consolidate the social perspective of a sector that, as FAO has indicated, must contribute with sustainable forms of work that give better results, for which Equipos Agricolas RA requires a formalization of social responsibility to realize an agenda of the same, from a marginal social responsibility. © 2019 CIRIEC.","Agricultural manufacturing; Corporate citizenship; Social commitment; Social responsibility","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078738872"

Using an annual panel, the estimates of the model – the family violence rate being the instrumental variable – show that an increase in the homicide rate of one unit reduces the appraisals by 1.6%. One plausible interpretation is that homicides operate as a regressive tax on property wealth in Cali because it is more concentrated in the communes of the lower socio-economic stratum, systematically expanding the intra-urban social distance. © 2016 Asociación Cuadernos de Economía","Crime; Land market; Social distance; Spatial analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85001728344"

The main objective is to analyze how dimensions of SAN (political, ethical, sociocultural, environmental, economic and nutritional) are articulated and contribute to the food and nutritional condition of farming families. The data were collected in 34 families in 2015 using four techniques: semi-structured interview, structured interview, participant observation and farmers-guided walks along their properties. There were also 10 interviews with institutions and organizations representatives. The analysis was carried out based on the theoretical-methodological framework of the multidimensionality of SAN (Rodríguez et al, 2019). The quantitative information was analyzed using IBM SPSS® and MS-Excel® software. The qualitative information was organized and presented from the predefined categories. Main results show that among the visited families, 68% of them were in food insecurity. Important differences have been found in the practices of families according to their condition of SAN in economic and nutritional dimensions. Families with SAN have greater economic resources and a greater number of people with overweight or obesity. The intrinsic relationship of families with nature stands out, which guides more sustainable practices. Such results let conclude, based on this study, that the multidimensional and multiscale approach allowed a broader understanding of the SAN, by analyzing both the strategies related to the various pillars (availability, access, consumption and biological use) and the dimensions that are linked to them. In addition, the nutritional dimension is considered as an expression of the sustainability of the agri-food system, suggesting that it is necessary adopting such dimension as a guide for rural development actions. © 2020, Centro de Investigaciones Agroalimentarias (CIAAL).

In other words, the Social and Solidarity Economy is a socio-economic area based on three main axes that determine its transforming character: democratic and participatory management, orientation towards human needs and commitment to the environment. In this way, it represents a new way of doing things, rather than a path towards a specific goal. In Spain, with the approval of the Social Economy Law in 2011, the sector has experienced a significant boost and growth in recent years. At the same time, new technologies are representing a disruptive change in our current society and are modifying the way we relate to each other. At this point, it is important to differentiate between the Internet of information and the Internet of value. The first is the tool that enables the free circulation of information throughout the planet and has led to the creation of new business models such as Google, Facebook or Amazon, among others. As for the Internet of value, based precisely on blockchain technology, it is the tool that makes possible to share and manage the value of assets or goods in a digital and decentralized way, without the need to depend on a trusted entity that centralizes the process. Blockchain technology, released in 2009 by Bitcoin, is a decentralized database that is distributed among a multitude of different participants. This distribution system establishes a system of group trust, since the information is distributed among different agents, it cannot be altered. Blockchain will revolution the future development of economies and societies, with a potential capable of transforming both industry and services, as well as social relations. In this case, the initiative has started in the financial sector mainly, although as it is evident, its application in the future will not have to be exclusive to that sector. The emergent development of blockchain technology and its possibilities to modify the forms of solidarity collaboration of citizens present a current challenge and a paradigm shift for the Third Sector. Today, society is changing the way to inform, to communicate and to relate. Faced with this reality, it is increasingly aware of its transforming role and driving agent of change. The significant evolution that information technologies have undergone in recent years has affected all sectors, including the Social and Solidarity Economy. For this reason, the aim of this article is to analyze the combination of the concept of Social and Solidarity Economy and blockchain, analyzing the possibilities of both areas sharing values, principles and objectives. The Social and Solidarity Economy framework developed by Chaves and Monzón (2018), as well as Corrons, Fuster and Espelt (2017), is mainly used for this purpose. In the first place, the concept of Social and Solidarity Economy and its current framework are analyzed, highlighting its three main vertebral axes. On the other hand, and based on the research led by Preukschat on blockchain, in addition to the definition of the concept, the levels at which it is stratified are identified: structure, properties, functional characteristics and usability. In order to complete the study, an analysis of the socioeconomic implications and barriers presented by this technology is presented. In short, the blockchain offers an opportunity to give authenticity to what is understood by collaborative with respect to the proposals that exist today. However, the main barriers that this technology presents are related to the implications of the current socioeconomic system. It provides freedom of action to individuals in the face of oligopolies, large corporations and States. The free exchange of crypto currencies implies no need for banks. The privacy of economic transactions implies the difficulty of taxation by States. And global and universal registration, without anyone being able to manipulate it, implies that all transactions are stored forever and, therefore, that there is no place for the right to forget or to a second chance. At present, there is a lack of research and studies that deal with this new technology, its possibilities and barriers to adapt to the consolidated concept of Social Economy. In this way, this analysis focused mainly on the study of existing literature, shows how blockchain technology has become the new paradigm in the Third Sector and how it can be the basic tool for changing the behavior of citizens in solidarity issues. In the near future, the disruptive technologies are called to cause a great impact in the traditional systems in benefit of the citizens, forcing to a vindication of the inefficient and obsolete current schemes. Here is where blockchain technology, configured in a way compatible with the principles of the Social Economy, can become a key tool that strengthens the Social Economy sector, that allows it to continue growing up and that manages to increase the impact of the aims of the entities that make it up. © 2019 CIRIEC-España, Revista de Economía Pública, Social y Cooperativa.","Blockchain; Governance; Social and solidarity economy; Technology; Values","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070369892"

Ice-Dammed Lake Outburst Floods (IDLOFs) are highlighted among these phenomena and reach a greater socio-economic impact due to their highly destructive power. Facing on forecasting of more frequency and intensity of dangerous events, risk analysis of communities exposed is required. The purpose of this research was to assess the hazard, vulnerability, and risk against IDLOF in the Plomo and Mendoza valleys in current scenarios. We analyze historical IDLOF events occurred in the Plomo River that was dammed at least three times by surges of the Grande del Nevado del Plomo glacier (GNP) generating six outburst floods in the 1788-2018 period. Almost one century after the most catastrophic event in 1934, many changes in land usage and occupation along the Mendoza valley have occurred, exposing new vulnerable elements to natural hazards in this area. Our findings show a greater risk mainly due to higher vulnerability as a consequence of higher habitat exposition associated with increasing tourist activity and land-use changes. This fact exposes an urgent necessity of land-use planning in Andean regions. © Universidad de La Rioja.","Central Andes; Ice-dam; Natural risks; Outburst floods; Risk mapping","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090816073"

These systems have multiple biotic and abiotic factors that hinder their zoning and classification, and therefore, the transfer of technology between producers and technicians is limited. The objective of the present investigation was to generate thematic maps of the distribution and aptitude of the land with productive potential for coffee cultivation in the agroforestry systems of the mountainous area of the municipality of Huatusco, Veracruz. For this, remote perception analysis (PR) techniques were used, with a parametric approach on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), interpretative land classification and local knowledge. Two agroforestry components are presented in the study area: mountain mesophilic forest (BMM) (27%) and paddock (Pot) (16%) and three subcomponents: traditional polyculture (Pt), commercial polyculture (Pc) (36%), specialized monoculture (Me) (3%) and urban areas (Zu) (2.9%), identified by their brilliance and texture in a satellite image; however, there is confusion between native and commercial vegetation. With the participation of the producers, these components were identified with an accuracy of 78.9% (Pc), 87.5% (Pt) and 100% (BMM, Pot, Me). The area of greatest aptitude for coffee production is located in the central zone (23%); while those of low quality are in the center and northeast (45.5%) of the municipality. BMMs occur in areas not suitable for coffee production. The combination of geospatial techniques with local knowledge of land aptitude allows identification of areas with agricultural potential for coffee production, providing elements for conservation of other environments such as the BMM. © 2018 Mexican Society of Soil Science.

The private/commercial model has a greater weight than the social model, although each autonomous community has its own particular situation. In this sense, Extremadura is a singular case in which both models show a balance in superficial extension. Despite this, while the so-called commercial hunting has a bibliographic corpus of certain relevance, the opposite has happened with social hunting. For this reason, the main objective of this work is to generate knowledge about a hunting model that is very representative in Extremadura, the social model. Of special interest in this work is the carrying out of a survey in which more than 130 local societies of federated hunters have participated in the region. The analysis of the answers obtained has been carried out using statistical techniques that have allowed interesting results to be obtained. Among them it is worth mentioning the notable masculinization of these societies, the low hunting quality of the lands they manage and the difficulties they encounter to undertake certain measures, due to the lack of economic resources. © 2019 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

To this aim, we will use the Transparency Index of the Autonomous Communities (INCAU), elaborated by Transparency International Spain, that is based fundamentally on contrasting whether these entities publish information relating to a set of 80 indicators, which try to cover the most important areas of information that the government of an Autonomous Community (AC) should make publicly available to society. In the selection of these 80 indicators, specialists and technicians from numerous institutions have been collaborating (Transparency International Spain, 2018). Specifically, INCAU has a twofold objective: (i) to evaluate the level of transparency of the governments of the different ACs and (ii) to encourage and promote the increase in the information that these institutions provide to citizens and to society as a whole. This index has been produced every two years since 2010. It only assesses whether the required information is available or not, but it does not evaluate the quality of the information published, nor that of the management of the governments of different ACs. Each AC obtains a score, the INCAU, giving rise to a classification of the level of transparency of the seventeen autonomous governments. INCAU is made up of several transparency sub-indexes: a) Information on the Autonomous Community; b) Relations with citizens and society; c) Economic-financial transparency; d) Transparency in contracts for services, works and supplies; e) Transparency in matters of land use planning, urban planning and public works; f) Indicators of the Transparency Law. In this research we will focus on the area of economic-financial transparency. Taking into account the previous literature, it has been considered that the socioeconomic factors that can explain the level of transparency are the population, the economic level (unemployment), the educational levels of citizenship, the use of the Internet by citizens, the budget deficit or surplus and the indebtedness. Political factors include the ideology of the ruling political party, the gender of the president, electoral participation and political competition. Methodology In order to measure the degree of budgetary transparency of the Spanish ACs, we use the index of economic-financial transparency published by Transparency International Spain. Therefore, the dependent variable of our model is this index, and the data have been obtained for the years 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. There are two possible scoring levels in each of the 80 indicators that make up the INCAU: a) 1 point: the information on the indicator is published on the AC website; b) 0 points: the information on the indicator is not published on the AC website. Based on the total score obtained by each of the ACs evaluated (the sum of their scores in the 80 indicators), Transparency International Spain prepares the final transparency ranking of the ACs (with a score ranging from 1 to 100, with 100 being the most transparent) both at an overall level and in each of the six areas of transparency that have been evaluated. For the last year considered (2016), the most transparent AC is the Basque Country, followed by the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and Madrid. On the other hand, on the less transparent side we find ACs such as Navarre, Extremadura or Aragon. In relation to the average of all the years analysed, the ACs with the best data are Catalonia, Castilla-Leon and La Rioja, with the three being above 80 points on average in the assessment of their levels of economic-financial transparency. In addition, those with the lowest levels of transparency on average in the period analysed are Castilla-la Mancha and the Comunidad Valenciana, which scarcely reach a score of 60 points. In order to analyse the explanatory factors of the levels of budgetary transparency, a linear multiple regression model has been proposed, which is estimated by means of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. Results The following table shows a summary of the hypotheses initially put forward and whether they have finally been accepted or rejected after comparing them in the model proposed in our methodology. Conclusions/Limitations/Implications Analysis of the evolution of the ACs' economic-financial transparency index has enabled us to observe that its own publication has been one of the greatest stimuli for governments to increase their level of public information. This is a fact that undoubtedly implies a limitation to the dependent variable used in our model, since the range of variation of this is reduced over time, and many ACs are approaching to the transparency indexes of 100% in 2016. Therefore, it is possible that, over time and with the publication of new transparency indexes, the model proposed in this study will no longer be significant to the extent that the dependent variable (the transparency index) will tend to be uniform (the value of the index of all the ACs will be or will become 100%). In addition, it should not be forgotten that another of the limitations of these indicators is that the quality of the information issued by governments is not included in their analysis, but only the publication of this information itself. It should also be noted that any dissemination involves several costs, mainly in terms of staff time dedicated to the preparation of the information. However, much of the information is prepared periodically for compliance with obligations to other administrative bodies. That is why we believe that the advance of transparency in the field of autonomy is a question of predisposition, will and know-how, rather than of significant technological investments. In this sense, we also believe that regional governments should opt to continue improving their levels of transparency, especially those ACs of smaller size, as we have concluded in the study that they are the ones with lower levels of transparency. This can be achieved through improvements in the means by which they communicate information. Thus, as we have concluded, the population's access to the Internet is a factor that very positively affects the levels of transparency. Therefore, ACs must put emphasis on this type of means in order to provide quality information with sufficient clarity to the citizens. Normally, institutions tend to make data public, but not understandable to a large part of the citizenry. For this reason, the role of citizens is to continue asking for exhaustive, clear and complete information about the management of public administrations. As future areas of research that allow us to complement and deepen the study of the levels of transparency, the creation of new indexes would be positive in order to check the similarities and differences between them, including in the calculation of these indexes the quality and clarity of the information published by the public administrations. It would also be positive to analyse the evolution of the transparency index through panel data when there is a longer period of time. © 2012 Universitat de València.","Autonomous Communities; Budgets; Regional governments; Transparency","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070781615"

This paper investigates the relationship between wages and GDP in Denmark, Norway and Sweden from 1800 to 1910, using wage series for workers in agriculture as well as crafts and industry. It shows wages trailing GDP from the 1840s to the mid-1870s, with a particularly pronounced such trend in Norway. On the other hand, wages generally increase at the same pace as GDP in the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s. The early 1870s is a break point also for food real wages which start increasing at that point. Four explanations for the varying fortunes of workers are tested: price developments, population growth, emigration, and institutional changes. Variations in labour supply, stemming from population growth and emigration, are shown to be the most important determinant. © 2017 Asociación Española de Historia Económica","Economic history; Living standards; Scandinavia; Wages","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022008029"

What is the meaning of water as an economic resource? We can identify two approaches or interpretations. The first considers water to be an input (a productive input), as any other in an economic system. In this context, water must have a price or be transferred through market institutions. These economic tools will create an efficient use of the water, that is, more benefits. Water thereby becomes a commodity. The second interpretation is defined in broader economic terms. Water as an economic resource means that it is a scarce resource and must be carefully managed to attain the goals established by a particular society. Treating water as an economic good does not imply the use of one specific set of economic tools. While prices, markets, private property, etcetera are tools that can all be found in a particular toolbox, other toolboxes exist. There are other ways to sustainably manage water from a social, economic and ecological point of view. We will apply this second interpretation to the analysis of water management in traditional communities. We will attempt to answer the question of whether traditional communities manage water as an economic resource. Social science research about the management of small scale irrigation systems shows that those systems generally manage water as an economic resource; that is, as a scarce resource. Although traditional irrigation systems had generally operated well in social, economic and ecological terms, modern water science and policies have ignored them, transforming or destroying them by applying universal concepts, criteria and tools. We conclude that traditional and indigenous institutions and organizations have many lessons to teach in regard to the treatment and management of water, and they should be supported and protected. © 2015 Tecnología y Ciencias del Agua.","Integrated Water Resources Management; Sustainable management; Traditional and indigenous irrigation systems; Water; Water as an economic good; Water culture","County Dublin; Dublin [County Dublin]; Ireland; Leinster; Callithrix; efficiency measurement; irrigation system; resource management; sustainability; traditional knowledge; water economics; water management; water resource","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943394483"

We also seek for those aspects that could complementary one another at different levels, such as the organization and business management, the markets function, the role of the State and the citizenship, all of them key factors to transform our present economy in an democratic, fair and sustainable alternative. Today's global crisis is an environmental, economic, social and political crisis that has fuelled the academic debate around alternatives to the neoliberal system, and the practices of the social and solidarity economy as means to overcome these issues and transform our economic, social and political reality. This debate, in fact, has moved from the academic field into the political and legal arena. In 2009, The European Parliament passed a resolution on the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) in order to acknowledge and promote it. Afterwards, in 2015, The European Social and Economic Committee gave a favourable opinion on the Economy for the Common Good and the creation of a ""European ethic market"". This is a theoretical study. On section 2, we introduce the main characteristics of the Social Economy first and then the Solidarity Economy, to end up explaining how they merge in a unique term: The Social and Solidarity Economy as well as what their practical proposals are to transform the economic system. On section 3, we focus on the Economy for the Common Good, starting with the definition of Common Good, we introduce later its main transformative proposals. On section 4, we identify the similarities and differences between these three - The Social and Solidarity Economy and the Economy for the Common Good-, and how they complementary each other at different levels. We end this paper with some conclusions on section 5. Multiple global crisis and heightened concerns about the social and environmental consequences of economic growth and liberalization have reignited interest in alternative production and consumption patterns and ways of organizing enterprise activities, with a considerable attention on Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), which is used to refer to organizations and enterprises engaged in the production and exchange of goods and services that are autonomous from the state and guided by social objectives and values that place human well-being, cooperation and solidarity at their core. These organizations include cooperatives, mutual associations, women's self-help groups, unions of informal economy workers, fair trade networks, and solidarity finance schemes. Many studies demonstrate that the SSE not only reduces the scope for negative social and environmental externalities associated with the conventional for-profit enterprise, but also fosters equitable patterns of resource and surplus distribution and promotes social, cultural and power relations that can be considered democratic, empowering and emancipatory. On the other hand, the Economy for the Common Good has emerged in Europe as an alternative to replace an economic system that is running into fundamental structuring problems. Its founder, Christian Felber, seeks to address a capitalist system that creates a number of serious problems, such as unemployment, inequality, poverty, exclusion, hunger, environmental pollution and degradation and climate change. The ECG proposes an economic system that applies standards for human relationships as well as constitutional values to the economy in order to reward economic stakeholders for behaving and organizing themselves in a humane, cooperative, ecological and democratic way. For this purpose, five fundamental values: human dignity, cooperation and solidarity, ecological sustainability, social justice and democratic co-determination and transparency form the basis of the ECG model. The ECG vision would be world changing and applies 20 utopian principles - including income caps, limitations on private wealth, and a move to nationalize natural resources to say a few. However, in the shorter range, the ECG activities are more pragmatic and attain to apply the Common Good Balance sheet to organizations and businesses. This balance sheet measures their contribution to these former five values and therefore, their contribution to the Common Good. Businesses can make their Common Good Balance public, consumer awareness, nonetheless, in only one of the ECG targets, since it is necessary to get the administration involved in order to develop a system of economic benefits that awards sustainable and responsible organizations and enterprises against those that don't behave in an ethical and environmentally friendly way. In this regard, it is necessary to work locally and with grassroots groups, like the Solidarity Economy does, in order to create awareness and mobilize the public and politicians to change the predatory system we live today in for another that promotes human well-being. Politically and economically, the ECG is still on the fringes but it has already demonstrated its ability to draw together a partnership of companies, consumers and communities, and draw political attention. The SSE also works in line to receive the recognition and priority they deserve in national and international knowledge and policy circles. However, meaningful policy change requires a reconfiguration of social and political forces, coalitions and alliances as well as democratic governance arranges that enable effective participation of intended beneficiaries and their advocates. As a result of this study we've found that the SSE and the ECG share the same economic vision, the economic system must work to serve human beings and their well being and must be based on social values and objectives to attain it. For both, the Solidarity Economy and the ECG, this goal can only be achieved through emancipation and empowerment of people. In the Solidarity Economy, thanks to the self-organization of citizens and their economic activities; in the ECG through the transformation of the representative democracy into a democracy that is also participatory and direct and places the system under democratic control. Both alternatives realize that this process involves a change in values first and for the most, and another way of thinking about economic activity. The SSE has a longer tradition and a much broader field experience, while the ECG was created in 2010 with just one particular proposal. The SSE was originated to answer and solve immediate social problems, and the ECG thanks to the believe that is necessary to overcome today's economic predatory system with an alternative model that promotes human well being and is based on social values and objectives. However, the SSE has very strict requirements for enterprises to be conceptualized as SSE businesses, while the ECG can host all different types of organizations and businesses, all of them can apply the Common Good Balance sheet (CGB), which works as a roadmap to re-direct their activities in line with the five ECG values that promote common good. The Solidarity Economy believes there are numerous ways of organizing economically, and challenges the idea all development is like Western development, demanding taht only the people should decide what development means for them and how they want to develop. However, the ECG has created a tool that seeks to transform reality from inside the markets. Economic decisions are still based on the prices, but these prices assume the social costs derived from economic activities. The application of the CGB aligns the enterprise activity with social needs and objectives in a way that the CGB helps to create shared social value. In our view, these proposals are complementary, and the reform of the market proposed by the ECG would be the right place for the development of SSE initiatives. Both, the SSE and the ECG need the intervention of the State, not to solve the problems created by the markets, but in order to co-create a different type of market, but this can be attained only through the strengthen of direct democracy, new spaces for self-organization and common goods management, the redefinition of the concept of private property, the design of new development policies, the change in the economic incentives for businesses and the market, and even a change in the operating parameters of the public sector itself. As limitations, we believe the SSE has difficulties to reach all sectors of society and align them with their program, while the ECG needs the administration to get involved to change the economic incentives of businesses and the market. And maybe, the major challenge, for the SolE and the ECG, is to demonstrate the democratic principles can be a method to regulate the economic production and consumption of goods and services. © 2016 CIRIEC-España.","Common good; Democracy; Relational goods; Social economy; Solidarity economy; Values","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85001094019"

Its rate of growth seems unstoppable and it is being introduced in traditional sectors such as the manufacturing sector, the provision of professional and financial services and more substantially, in the tourism sector as well as the accommodation and transport subsectors. With this in mind the following project intends to: A) further the study in the different proposals that have been defined regarding the definition of collaborative economy and suggest its own definition as to what we understand by collaborative economy; b) analyse the benefits and conflicts that this new economy generates when implemented; c) provide new information about how collaborative economy is used in the European Union; d) analyse the latest trends that are taking place in collaborative tourism, specifically in the transport and accommodation sectors in Spain, going into depth regarding the obstacles the traditional competitors and public administrations are trying to place before its development. In order to accomplish these goals, a broad review of all the information available related to collaborative economy has been conducted at the European level. The main studies and documents that have been published by different organisations of the European Union have been analysed and, for Spain, all reports issued by the National Commission of Market and Competition have been studied, as well as the different legal decisions that have been taken in Spain during recent years regarding this matter. Following this methodology, it can be shown in relation to a collaborative economy that multiple activities have some things in common such as the use of online platforms, the temporary use of resources, the relation between consumers or the exchange of goods and services. Nevertheless, many of the activities related to this sector do not really belong to it. In reality, part of these activities are only new business models that have little to do with a collaborative scheme. That is why as per our point of view, a collaborative economy or better said a pure sharing economy is an economic and social pattern where economic and social agents share in a temporary way, with a clear social goal, assets, goods and services which were untapped in many cases, in exchange for money or other services, using online platforms as support. Therefore, this social goal will exclude from the pure collaborative economy those business models where third parties work for profit. In spite of the recent emergence of the collaborative economy phenomenon, there is no doubt that the figures show huge growth and a powerful future for this new business model which is leading to important changes in the provision of relations and the supply chain structure, regarding the distinction between property and the ability to use numerous goods. The profound economic and financial crisis that has affected most of the world economies, significantly reducing the purchasing power of families and individuals, has led to collaborative economy as a way to decrease the negative impacts of the crisis. Although a collaborative economy is being implemented in numerous economic sectors such as the production of goods, professional and financial service delivery, education, health or logistics, the tourism sector is becoming increasingly important in this field, especially in relation to transportation and accommodation. In any case, when new business models emerge, companies and businessmen who have reached a certain status see their position as being in danger if the situation changes and new suppliers appear without any regulation in the market. This is what is happening when drivers and companies in the taxi sector and hotel chains are faced with these new ways of generating business. With this in mind, the European Union has clearly adopted a position in favour of collaborative economy. The Economic and Social European Committee, with an opinion issued in 2014 named: 'Collaborative or participative consumption: A sustainability model for the XXI century'; the European Commission, in June 2016 with the publication entitled: 'A European schedule for collaborative economy', which was addressed to the European Parliament, The Economic and Social European Committee and to the Committee of the Regions, are pursuing its development, providing certain guidelines to help consumers, companies and public authorities to take part in a collaborative economy because it is a new type of offer and use of products and services that involves numerous sectors and provides new opportunities to all the interested parties. However, public administrations of some EU countries, like Spain, which restrict and in some cases block, the full development of this type of economy, even though each autonomous community with a strong lack of coordination, has the capacity for better law-making in the touristic field, is providing different treatments for these activities especially those related to the touristic use of housing (must remember there are not touristic housing). On the other hand, the Spanish National Commission of Market and Competition is recommending concrete proposals to promote a collaborative economy. In conclusion and as per our opinion, in order to have a proper coexistence between the activities developed in a collaborative economy area as well as a traditional one, it is necessary to have regulations providing clear rules of the game. In this sense Edelmanas and Gerardinas (2015) projects explore the need for clear regulation of platforms, in such a way that Airbnb or Uber companies would be able to do their job, but strictly sticking to the rules. In line with this but concentrating in collaborative accommodation, Fernandez Perez in 2016 brings to light the problems in Spain, due to the coexistence of national rules with other autonomous communities, especially in the tourism sector, advocating for proper coordination between autonomous communities taking into account the restrictions of the State. All these difficulties and a deep analysis that each community is carrying out in order to regulate touristic housing, can be seen in Guillen (2015), Guillen and Iniguez (2015), in addition to Guillen and Iniguez (2016), even though some authors like Jefferson-Jones (2015) call into doubt the legal restrictions created in the United States in touristic accommodation, specifically the legality of short-term rents. Quattrone et al. (2016) provide recommendations about how town halls should establish, improve and accomplish all regulations related to collaborative tourism, such as Airbnb in London, in a way that they generate profit for society. This actual study shows as a main restriction the simple fact of confinement, basically to the European Union and in particular to Spain, whereas in other regions and countries such as the United States, the collaborative economy is more developed. The key value of this project consists in understanding the economy phenomenon and collaborative tourism, recommending a new definition of a pure collaborative economy concept. On the other hand giving substance to the collaborative economy has reached several countries in a short period of time and will be expanded in the near future according to all predictions. Finally, analysing the different approaches and conflicts the European Union is supporting as well as the public administrations of some countries that incorporate them into collaborative economy deployment is required.","Collaborative economy; European Union; News business models; Sharing tourism; Tourism accommodation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011601346"

Authors such as Martin and Sunley (1996) and Moncayo (2004), make judicious tour of the international literature on the discussion of regional economic inequality. Equally, Lambooy and Boschma (2001) and Martin and Sunley (2006), Page (2006), Scott (2006) and others, have developed important analysis of the role of technological development at the regional level. However, there is not enough clarity on the relationship between technological progress and regional economic imbalances. This paper seeks to examine how technology is conceived and the characteristics of the processes of diffusion of technological change between different regions of a country. From the different theoretical approaches are to identify elements of analysis to help explain how technological progress affects regional economic imbalances. The paper argues that the role of technology in economic growth is not neutral between regions due to the development and incorporation into the production system requires particular conditions. Consequently, when these conditions are heterogeneous across regions, the impact of technological progress on productivity of the economic system is asymmetric, which results in the formation of technological trajectories and accumulation of productive resources in favor of one region to the detriment of other strengthening economic imbalances between regions. From the second half of the twentieth century, technological progress is recognized as a resource for economic production and since then it is assigned a potential effect on economic growth and development. Given the importance of the economic literature, theoretical and empirical level, assigned to technological progress, requires a conceptual approach to the issue of technology and its relationship with economic development. This case is taken as a reference to Mokyr (2003: 6) for whom the ""Technology is knowledge. Knowledge, as is well known, has always been a difficult concept for standard economics to handle. It is at the core of modern economic growth, but many characteristics make it slippery to handle. ()The basic unit of analysis of technology is the ""technique."" A technique is a set of instructions on how to produce goods and services. () While technology often depends on artifacts, the artifacts are not the same as the technique and what defines the technique is the content of the instructions."" However, among the first authors who gave an important role to technological change in economic development is Schumpeter, who argues that technological change is induced by the nature of capitalism that is derived primarily from competitive structures and the need of capitalist to sustain the market. These proposals are the origin of evolutionary economic theory, which is supported on a metaphor that refers to biological processes, although there are important differences between manufactured and what comes from a natural birth, but evolutionary metaphor is a effective tool to explain the history of technological change (Basalla, 1991). Those who approach the problem of technological progress from the biological perspective, are two categories in the analysis. On one hand, micromutations arise, which are small changes that occur in an existing species and gradually altering their features. This phenomenon is associated with microinvenciones, which are small progressive steps that improve, adapt or modernize existing techniques already in use, thereby perfecting their form and function, reduces costs, increases durability and decreases the energy and raw materials. On the other hand, appear macromutations, resulting in new species, which in this context equivalent to the macro inventions, which are to be those inventions of which emerges a radically new idea. This analytical approach concludes that the dynamics of technological progress, the macro inventions and microinvenciones not replace, but complement (Mokyr, 1993). According to Elster (2000), variations are random, and are usually very small and the result is a local maximum, which means you can choose the best result, but this is best only locally, because you can not compare it to other places as the actors are different and preferences are different, and probably not known other benchmarks. The imperfection of the original builder, allowing the final perfection, this implies that there is no optimal, universal nor permanent. This approach leaves asymmetries implicit relationship between economic growth and technical progress for each economic region. Of the approaches of Schumpeter, Mokyr and Elster, inferred how innovations arise, however for dissemination through the production system requires additional conditions as previous knowledge accumulated by organizations. However, there are conditions that slow the process of diffusion of innovations, as expounded Soet and Turner, ""The importance of the diffusion of innovation rather than the mere occurrence of innovations is of course the mayor factor underlying most of the microeconomic diffusion literature. The fundamental reason for delay in adopting -the so-called retardation factors- have been found to relate both to uncertainty and lack of information about the new technology and the often proprietary nature of the new technology."" (Soet and Turner, 1984: 612). In this context, previous knowledge is complementary to the more specific knowledge required for new activities. But, in each industry there is a specific knowledge base on which these developments continue, however, these knowledge bases available are different in each place, which allows the existence of different rhythms and skill sets for innovation. Also, the knowledge and skills acquired by a firm are cumulative, which tends to reduce the randomness in the search results of innovations and this will determine the economic regions and technologies used, as it creates favorable conditions for their use and development. According to the evolutionary approach, technological development follows a path around specific properties that act as search rules, technological imperatives and accumulation of expertise within each technological paradigm. As a result, you get a diversity among firms is a permanent and fundamental technological change and its asymmetric effects in the industrial environment. This condition of permanent asymmetries conditions the process of diffusion of innovations, which may face two scenarios: homophily y heterophily. In the first referenced when interacting group of individuals has similar characteristics and the second is when interacting groups of individuals with different characteristics. The latter is the most common as Rogers poses. However the behavior of entrepreneurs in different economic activities, making different rates, which may explain disparities in technological progress among economic sectors and between industries. From this perspective, the dynamics of regional growth based on innovation and technology, assumes a different pattern in relation to the geographical and historical status. That is, the relationship between these variables and growth is not stable over time, but this may be changing, which will allow the growth rates of the regions and their economic activities are oscillations or cycles in a given period. In this sense, the institutional conditions, availability of information and technology resources make the difference between regions in relation to the role of creativity and the development of a region in relation to other. Of Analysis that posed Martin and Sunly, it follows that in each region, there is a provision of conditions which form a specific context in which it takes place, different technological mutations, but these mutations, even random, will be conditioned, or at least its purpose for a specific context. In the regional analysis, it is necessary to place two aspects in relation to the processes of diffusion of a technology: This process depends, among other things, whether the macroinvención or macromutation took place within the region, or if instead , this occurred in another region, and what geographical, intellectual, historical, cultural and technological separating the two regions. Therefore, the structural heterogeneity in underdeveloped regions, it becomes a limit to the link between business processes and thus prevents the integration of economic space. ""In those cases, the possibilities for firms to build capabilities depend almost entirely on internal efforts, which would act as a strong restriction on learning opportunities"" Robert y Yougel 2010: 442). This approach shows that each region is an abstract set of interrelationships of different order, which under particular dynamics, are setting their own functional forms to relate the determinants of economic growth. Surely when comparing a group of regions must identify a number of common elements around growth, but the shape and intensity as they relate to each other, show important differences between them.","Economic inequality; Economic structure; Evolutionary economics; Technological change; Technological diffusion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896793795"

One of these changes is to raise livestock to achieve two production goals, rather than one. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in production units (PU) with dual-purpose (DP) livestock in Southern Estado de Mexico. In 2006, with technical and economic follow-ups, information was obtained from 50 livestock farmers chosen by random sampling. Fourteen structure and management variables were evaluated (abandonment of livestock activity, labour availability, feeding, surface and size of herd), along with 14 economic variables, all of which were obtained with structured surveys. All the livestock farmers provided reliable information for the validation of the data, which were also contrasted with the records in the PU and with key informers and official statistics for the economic variables. Such variables were evaluated in the same sample in 2013. The statistical method used was a Student t test, for the comparison of average values of the 28 variables between dates. During the seven-year period, 56 % of the livestock farmers abandoned the activity and labour fell by 42 % (p≤0.05). The surface and size of the herd remained equal (p>0.05). The changes in the feeding and total income per cow and surface (ha) were significant (p≤0.05). The PU DP changed their structure, land use, feeding, management of the PU's and therefore, the organization and orientation of livestock production. Tendencies indicate that the changes in livestock farming in southern Estado de México will continue.","Bovines; Changes; Dry tropic; Dual-purpose; Production units","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992446873"

A lumped dynamic model has been developed which focuses on the socio-economic factors and land-use changes and their effects on the watershed-scale nutrient flows. In addition, a preliminary application of the ELM (Ecological Landscape Model), an eco-hydrological spatial dynamic model, has been carried out as an ongoing improvement of the hydrological modelling module. Simulation results for the 1970-2012 period showed a noticeable increase in nutrient inflows into the Mar Menor lagoon, highlighting the high inter-annual variability and the role of associated wetlands to remove part of the nutrients. The modeling approach was applied to explore the potential effects of several management measures aiming at reducing the export of nutrients from the agricultural fields into the Mar Menor lagoon, particularly studying measures to reuse agricultural leakages and plans for wetlands restoration. Results showed that wetlands restoration achieves a higher reduction in the inflow of nutrients into the lagoon, doubling those achieved by reusing agricultural leakages. © 2013 Los Autores.

The results have broad implications for neighbouring Mediterranean EU economies given similarities in the relative size and structure of primary agriculture, and in the macro-economic difficulties they face. Comparing with a baseline scenario, it is estimated that the crisis induces a cumulative contraction of 8 per cent in Spanish agricultural activity by 2015, with concomitant reductions in real farming incomes of 9 per cent. Notwithstanding, in accordance with previous literature and a priori expectations, this contraction is notably smaller than in non-food sectors. Comparing between agricultural activities, the supply response to the crisis varies considerably owing to differing input intensities and sales destina- tions. The highest supply responsiveness occurs in relatively capital or unskilled labour intensive sectors, or export orientated sectors; whilst land intensive sectors are more resistant to the economic downturn. Finally, we find greater income inequality across Spanish households, with utility from food consumption falling 10% in the poorest segment, compared with only 1% in the wealthiest.","Agriculture; Computable general equilibrium","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875898079"

Coverage, structure, and composition of vegetation have a fundamental influence in controlling the energetic input in the aquatic ecosystem.

The results indicate that the Chaihuín river has a better quality of vegetation on its banks, compared with Lingue river, where low QBR values are product of the replacement of natural riparian vegetation due to establishment of agricultural land and forest plantations.

Ijuíis localized in de basin of same name northwest of RS. In the XVI century arrived the Jesuits missioners who organized the natives in small villages that got be important economical centers of mate herb and cattle settled this area firstly. In 1759 the Portugal Minister declared a law ejected the Jesuits of his territories and the land remained free of settlers. Then with the independence, Brazil opened the commercial success with sugar cane plantations, coffee and the gold ore extraction. The slave covered the labor required for these activities, after slave abolition the Brazilian Government invited and made laws in favor of immigrants to come to Brazil to work in a salaried system that was influenced by the European capitalism in expansion. To maintain sugar cane and coffee plantations as the gold ore extraction, were created agricultural and cattle poles in environmentally strategic areas, in this way IRB was settled by Germans ethnics. The Ijuícolonization began with the official founding of the Colony Ijuí on October 19, 1890, where installed a hundred families and by Decree no 1814, on January 31, 1912, was established as an autonomous municipality. The colonization settled Russians and Polands with German roots, in 1981 arrived Italians and Swedishs; with the First World War arrived Germans, Lithuanians, Austrians, in 1895 Arabians. The socioeconomic function was determined by their knowledge of land use and their lifestyles, identified by habits (dances, rites, foods, clothes, linguistic dialects, religion, etc). The region was developed through settler's work that drove it as a commercial and industrial empire, the experience of immigrants in industry work and organization favored the rapid economic development of the region. The settlers knew little or nothing riograndense climate, but created economies based in local crops such as yerba mate, the use of land for farming of cereals and vegetables, livestock, mainly pigs exploitation of natural resources such as power generators, and the river to produce electricity and give rise to other industries. Environmental, economic and social development in the IRB depended on capitalist development model adopted by Brazil to ensure an economically prosperous society. The natural areas became cities in intensive fields, grazing areas and industrial complexes, and consumption is not encouraged conservation. The economy prospered thanks to environmental management as an energy source to operate it and the production of goods for consumption and trade. Emerged a new cultural identity following the convergence of different ethnicities in the same space, the most deeply rooted traditions of that combination persist to this day, others were created over time to strengthen the sense of belonging in the region. Now at days Ijuí are exploited for agriculture, are reminiscent of the natural flora in the bank and there is a highly developed industrial complexes in urban areas. By the high cultural level the region is known as the ""land of diverse cultures"" by the prevailing number of ethnicities and express their cultural traits. Ijuí represents migration policy of colonial Brazil, in a small land gaúcha converge a variety of races and nationalities that reflect a new Brazilian identity. Despite the ethnic, groups stay in touch as part of territorial ownership and its economic and cultural development.","Brazilian colonization; Cultural identity; Economic development; Gaúcho; Ijuí; System lake","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954554327"

Hence, this paper analyzes the current status quo of social responsibility reporting in the Spanish water sector. The paper seeks to add to the understanding about the level of disclosure on social responsibility in the public sector, given the increased focus on transparency at government level, strongly demanded by society. Design / methodology / approach Quantitative and qualitative content analysis is the methodology used in this exploratory study, a highly flexible research method that has been widely used in previous literature. Given the exploratory nature of this work, only public and mixed water supply and sanitation entities were chosen. To identify those entities that prepare a social responsibility report in compliance with GRI, the database maintained by GRI reports on its website (http://database.globalreporting.org) was first consulted. The main websites of companies and industry bodies were subsequently consulted to verify that none had been left out of the analysis. Nine entities were identified to have prepared GRI reports from 2003 to 2014; these were analyzed in order to describe disclosure trends and application. Subsequently, with the aim of analyzing the indicators disclosed, 3 out of the 9 initially identified entities were also ruled out for comparability (not using GRI 3.1 version for disclosure) and reliability (several deficiencies in the contents and index of the report) issues. Therefore, the disclosure of performance indicators included in the 2013 or 2014 G3.1 reports of three public and three mixed entities was finally analyzed using the content analysis methodology. Firstly, we analyzed whether or not the indicator was reported. In the first case, the indicator disclosed was classified according to the information provided in one of the following four categories: qualitative / quantitative / monetary/ monetary and quantitative. If an indicator was not reported, it was also analyzed if a justification was provided for the omission. Results / Research limitations / implications Altogether, 52 GRI reports from nine entities were identified from 2003 to 2014. The vast majority are reports published on an annual and continuous basis during this period. All entities began to publish social responsibility reports following the GRI guidelines, except Aguas de Murcia which had written an annual environmental report since 2001. Although the results show a progressive adoption over the last decade of this type of reporting by larger institutions, there are differences in the levels of application adopted. Two groups have been identified. On the one hand, Canal Isabel II, Aguas de Albacete, Aguas de Murcia, Aguas de Alicante and Aguas de Gijon prepare a report externally verified at the maximum level of application as checked by GRI; and, on the other hand, Aguas de Sevilla, Aguas de Malaga, Aguas de Bilbao-Bizkaia and Aguas de Granada do not have their reports externally verified and consider themselves at an intermediate level of application. The first group consists mainly of mixed management entities, while the second is made up of public entities. No other criterion has been identified to significantly explain the behavior of these entities concerning the level of application of the GRI guidelines. As regards indicators, approximately three out of five performance indicators (56.2%) are provided, while two out of five are not (43.8%). About two out of three indicators reported were of a quantitative (28.3%), and to a lesser extent qualitative (15.9%) nature. In comparison, monetary (5.6%) and monetary & quantitative (2.4%) information was scarce. In the case of indicators in which information is omitted, the absence or omission of information in slightly more than three out of four indicators was justified. The economic dimension of sustainability concerns the organization's impact on the economic conditions of its stakeholders and on economic systems at local, national, and global levels. The analysis of economic indicators shows that reports include almost four out of five economic indicators. The environmental dimension of sustainability concerns an organization's impact on living and nonliving natural systems, including ecosystems, land, air, and water. Three out of five environmental indicators (61.1%) were reported, with qualitative information being disclosed in 46.1% of the indicators provided. Primary reference points on Labor Practices and DecentWork are Employment; Labor/Management Relations; Occupational Health and Safety; Training and Education; Diversity and Equal Opportunity; and Equal Remuneration for Women and Men. Virtually all the indicators in this section are disclosed in the reports (94.4%). The information is mainly quantitative in nature (67.8%), to a lesser extent qualitative (21.1%), and almost non-existent in the remaining categories. Human Rights Performance Indicators require organizations to report on the extent to which processes have been implemented, on incidents of human rights violations and on changes in the stakeholders' ability to enjoy and exercise their human rights, occurring during the reporting period. Among the human rights issues included are non-discrimination, gender equality, freedom of association, collective bargaining, child labor, forced and compulsory labor, and indigenous rights. This is the area where the smallest percentage of indicators is reported; less than one in every ten indicators (9.1%). However, the omission of most of them (80.3% of all indicators) is justified. Most dis- closures show that the activities carried out comply with current legislation, that there is no risk of breach in the compliance with human rights or that there is an ethical code available to employees and stakeholders. Society Performance Indicators focus on the impact organizations have on the local communities in which they operate, and disclose how the risks that may arise from interactions with other social institutions are managed and mediated. In particular, information is sought on the risks associated with bribery and corruption, undue influence in public policy-making, and monopoly practices. The analysis reveals that information in one of every three Society Performance Indicators (33.4 %) is provided. Nevertheless, its omission is justified in most other cases. The information included is mainly of a qualitative (30.0%) nature. Product Responsibility Performance Indicators address the aspects of a reporting organization's products and services that directly affect customers, namely, health and safety, information and labeling, marketing, and privacy. These aspects are chiefly covered through disclosure on internal procedures and the extent to which these procedures are not fulfilled. The analysis shows that information is disclosed in slightly more than one out of three indicators (35.1%), while less than two out of three are not disclosed (64.9%). It is important to note that indicators disclosed are primarily of quantitative information (25.8%) and that the omission of indicators is mostly justified. Therefore, reports analyzed mainly include information related to labor practices and work ethics, as well as economic and environmental aspects, with the disclosure of indicators on product responsibility, human rights and society issues being limited. The main research limitation is the exploratory nature of the research. Extensive care is needed when seeking to generalize or apply the findings to a different context, since the size of the population does not allow the statistical generalization of the study. In addition, the analysis of performance indicators was only conducted on the last year available. As a future line of research, GRI reports made by private water supply and sanitation services entities could be analyzed. Moreover, the role of private entities in mixed entities could be analyzed in greater depth. With regard to indicators, an aspect that would improve the relevance of the information provided, and its absence or omission, would be relating them to the materiality attributed by the company and stakeholders. Practical conclusions and original value This paper has analyzed the current status quo of social responsibility reporting in Spanish public water supply and sanitation entities. Although the results show a progressive adoption over the last decade of this type of reporting by larger institutions, there is concern about the levels of application adopted. Additionally, results show limited disclosure of indicators on product responsibility, human rights and society issues. Consequently, an overview of the current reporting was provided and specific shortcomings identified so that they could be improved. © 2016 CIRIEC-España.","Content analysis; Global reporting initiative reports; Public enterprises; Social responsibility; Water supply and sanitation sector","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000900005"

In order to determine the effect of a ski resort on livestock farming systems in its surroundings, a structured interview was conducted with all farmers whose herds (314 adult cows and 75 mares) grazed during the summer on pastures within a Pyrenean ski station (Aramón-Panticosa, Huesca). Information on labour, herd size, land use, management and technical performance of cattle and horses was collected, as well as recent dynamics and prospective changes under the current socio-economic circumstances and different scenarios, and their objectives and opinions about several issues. When compared with that of similar areas, farm management and performance was similar except for the high farmers' pluriactivity (60%). Continuity of the farms was ensured on a medium term, but might be low in the long run due to lack of succession. Farms were stable in terms of size and management, and few changes were envisaged in the future in the current socio-economic conditions.

Regarding their objectives, they considered that economic aspects and those related to their family's quality of life were crucial, while technical objectives were less important. Concerning their opinions about tourism, they considered that the valley and indirectly their farming activity had benefitted from the ski resort, mostly due to the alternatives for economic diversification that it provided, while in turn it profited from the ecosystem services provided by livestock grazing.","Farmers' attitudes; Livestock management; Mountain farming; Ski resorts","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897388558"

Despite the crisis originally being regarded as financial, it quickly spread to the rest of the economy. continuous and quickening changes have seen the seriousness and complexity of the crisis grow and develop to the point that it has become systemic, as it affects institutions, policies and even moral and ethical values, and also global in scale, as it is impacting on the whole planet, albeit affecting different areas in different ways and to different degrees. In this last respect, it is of special interest to see what spatial changes are resulting from the crisis, and, therefore, the ways that it is affecting the processes of spatial development. as is known, this conceptual category refers to the development model that can make economic competitiveness compatible with social well-being, environmental sustainability and the moderation of internal imbalances, which represents a goal that typifies a large part of people's collective aspirations. spatial development should also be considered from two angles: it should be evenly distributed over a given area and, in turn, be based on the conditions that make each of the different parts of this area special in their own way; in other words, it should promote spatial cohesion whilst respecting regional diversity (zoido, 2001; zoido-caravaca, 2006; Pita-Pedregal, 2011). It is a sufficiently tested fact that valorising resources is at the essence of spatial development processes; and whilst in a global world like today's many of the traditional economic resources have become unprecedentedly mobile, other heritage assets are firmly rooted, in spatial terms, which gives them a special added value. The existence of balanced urban systems is a major spatial resource from this point-of-view, with a dense network of small- and medium-size towns and cities which form the roots and branches of the region and can contribute to propagating development processes throughout it (berry, 1972; Haggett, 1988, etc.). It should therefore come of no surprise that this type of urban system, and more especially, the small- and medium-size towns and cities that make it up, have taken on a more significant role, not only in the field of the scientific literature (camagni-salone, 1993; laborie-Renard, 1998; bellet-llop coords, 2000, 2004; capel, 2003, etc.), but also in institutional discourse. a good example of this can be found in some of the documents produced by the european union: The European Spatial Development Perspective (1999), Study Programme on European Spatial Planning (2000), Reports on Economic and Social Cohesion (2004). However, along with the foregoing, it should not be forgotten that these are places that can be especially illustrative in an analysis of the spatial impacts of the crisis, as they not only concentrate the population, companies, institutions, knowledge and innovations that contribute to dynamising the economy during periods of growth, but they are also the places that are most negatively affected in times of recession. It is no surprise, then, that emphasis has been put on the crisis' urban roots (Harvey, 2012 b; Méndez, 2013a and c). In this general reference context, the aim of this article is to contribute to the knowledge of the impacts that the crisis has had on spatial development in andalusia, with attention also placed on the different effects that this is having on the towns and cities that make up the regional urban system. The reference dates used for this are 2006, 2009 and 2012, which enables differentiation between what occurred between 2006 and 2012, this being the last year for which generalised information is available on the municipal level. Reference periods are also used: 2006-2009, as the first phase when the crisis was developing, and 2009-2012, which can be considered the second stage, coinciding with the first austerity measures. bearing in mind that available statistical sources provide data on the municipal scale, the source for municipalities that are considered as urban has been chosen, i.e., municipalities that have a population exceeding 10,000 inhabitants. economic, social and environmental indicators have to be used to achieve the goal that has been set, as they shed the greatest light on the effects that the crisis has had on the andalusian spatial model and its different impacts on the towns and cities in the region. given the limitations of a study such as that proposed here, it has been necessary to choose the indicators considered to be most significant from all those available. of those directly linked to the way that the economy works, those analysed are the evolution of electricity consumption for industrial (commercial) use and the number of jobs. The latter is a baseline indicator for observing the behaviour of the economy and is especially important in a region like andalusia, which is characterised by the traditional inability of its economy to generate a sufficient amount of employment. bearing this in mind, the need to analyse the impact of the crisis on unemployment becomes evident. This is an indicator that can be considered not only economic, but also social, as it has a very direct effect on the social inequalities that, as is well-known, are emerging as the main problem in our societies (oecD, 2014; oxfam-Intermón, 2014). Meanwhile, the evolution of electricity consumption for household use helps to demonstrate the changes that the crisis is imposing on people's ways of life and consumer behaviour. Three other indicators directly linked to the provision of such basic social services as education, health and social welfare also demonstrate the undesired social effects of the crisis: the number of pupils per teacher, the ratio between hospital beds/1000 inhabitants and the number of places in healthcare centres. Information on the environment is much more limited on the municipal scale. Nevertheless, there is some information available that is especially interesting for spatial development processes: land surface that has been built on and changed, which is directly linked to the creation of the real estate bubble. Despite the inevitable limitations of a study such as this, it has been possible to draw some conclusions about the changes that have been experienced in the region's spatial development and the way that the towns and cities that make it up behave. It has been demonstrated that the effect of the crisis on the spatial development of urban spaces is closely linked to their economic (legacy economic structures, predominant activities, the capacity to generate employment, etc.) and spatial characteristics (the area in which they are located, natural and infrastructure resources that they possess, etc.). In short, there seems to be absolutely no doubt that an analysis of the crisis' spatial impacts is necessary for understanding the changes that have been produced in spatial dynamics, and that deepening knowledge of the various ways that the crisis is affecting urban areas can help regionally-differentiated measures and strategies to be proposed.","Andalusia; Crisis; Territorial development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921498723"

The objective of the article is to describe the impacts of the disaster on the sustainability of the Krenak people. It was a qualitative research, case study, which used primary and secondary data. The results demonstrate the death of fish, and other animals, important for a traditional Krenak food safety. As families were left without drinking water, that made impossible social activities, education, health, culture, religion, economy and leisure. In the view of the Krenak people, the major consequence was the death of Uatu, subtracting an important element of their identity, territoriality and sustainability.","Disaster of Samarco/Vale/BHP; Doce-Uatu River; Krenak; Sustainability","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038610163"

One of the reasons for this variety is the sheer size of the area covered, since they follow much of the River Guadalquivir along its 600 km course, through the provinces of Jaén, Córdoba and Sevilla, with the highest concentration on the left bank of the mid valley, although they stretch south west towards Cádiz and even west towards the peripheral plains of Huelva. These 'countrysides' create a continuous strip where the edges become blurred as they accommodate the tormented and ragged profiles of the Bética mountains, after which they spread out over different altitudes which - in the form of large and unequal steps - sweep down from the mountains and gradually occupy the large central river bed until they reach the river course itself, which erodes the Hercinian bedrock as it flows through. The structural foundation of this great valley stretching over 35,000 km2 was laid through the sedimentary filling process which began in the Miocene age although the final movements of the Alpine orogeny were still active, with the rest of the Tertiary and Quaternary ages continuing in complete orogenic calm, albeit subject to climatic alterations. This variety of events has caused the Guadalquivir depression to be differentiated into various sub-units of 'countrysides': the river plain, the low-lying countryside, the Villafranciese glacis and the high-lying countryside. The specific materials, altitudes, morphologies and soils of these sub-units paint varied landscapes that share an agrarian vocation, a social-historical process and a strong connection between crops and architectures. These countryside landscapes are equally determined by their central location within the region, which gives them a very privileged position in terms of their visibility, particularly the landscapes immediately surrounding the major communication and transport links. Hence, with their open horizons and soft clean lines, they have become one of the most typical and stereotypical images of Andalucía as a whole, specifically the Andalucía that is identified with orchards dominated by large estates. The adoption of the term 'Latifundio' for these large farming estates and what this has meant for the social and economic history of Andalucía over the last 150 years, endows these landscapes with a multitude of meanings, where the capacity of the landscape as palimpsest takes on particular importance, as does the need to turn to artistic expressions to attain true perception, understanding and interpretation. This capacity to represent the essence of Andalucía is reflected very well in the recurring presence the 'countrysides' and their landscapes in disciplines such as history, geography, agronomy, anthropology etc., as well as artistic expressions, since there have been and indeed are multiple and varied creative gazes of -by antonomasia-Andalucía's countryside, recreated by painters, writers, photographers and filmmakers, recreations in which the landscape plays a central role. The agrarian landscapes of these 'countrysides', owing to their dependence on the annual climatic cycle and its systems and crop types, inscribe this extreme region in the timelessness of the Mediterranean world. Wheat, grapes and olives are the holy fruits which, accompanied by fruit trees and other crops, make up the triad that balances the Mediterranean; in the words of F. Braudel: ""All life must be balanced. Or it will disappear: which is not the case with Mediterranean life, vivacious and indestructible. Life in this region is certainly tough, often precarious, and its balance regularly shifts against man, condemning him to endless sobriety."" (Braudel, 1985, p. 9) Perhaps this difficulty and sobriety sustains the beauty we find in these landscapes and the pleasure derived from their contemplation. Landscapes which, in this article, are shown as a fabric where certain physical, historical and social determinants have formed a dense strong web to construct their current images as civilised rural landscapes, serenely productive. Calming images maybe, but the gradual emptying of country people also empties them of many of their meanings, some of which are very recent which makes it difficult to know and understand them. There could be many different ways of approaching these representative landscapes of Andalucía, but this paper proposes the importance of always incorporating their artistic manifestations, where the land is always present: ""Drinking Corinthian sun, reading the marble ruins, striding through vineyards and seas aiming the harpoon at a votive fish that slips away found the leaves the sun's psalm learns by heart, the living earth desire rejoices. (Elytis, 1943, p. 8).","Artistic expressions; Countrysides; Farmhouses; Heritage; Household tasks; Landscape; Large estate; Mediterraneidad; Presses; The Guadalquivir","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879908035"

This vegetation type expands across a large altitudinal gradient (400-2300 m asl), where tree species turnover promotes the occurrence of three altitudinal belts (pre-montane forest, lower montane forest and upper montane forest), with associated changes in leaf phenology and dispersal syndromes. Deciduous tree species are dominant at the extremes of the gradient, and semi-deciduous and evergreen species are dominant at mid elevations. Alternatively, wind- and gravity-dispersed tree species characterize the lower part of the gradient, while animal-dispersed trees characterize the upper part of the gradient. Physical and biological changes along the altitudinal gradient determine uses and conservation strategies. Deforestation of subtropical Yungas reached 18% of the original distribution in Argentina during the 1970's, and raised up to 31% by 2010, mainly (>90%) over low and flat areas.

The human capital endowment is seen as a key to promote growth and competitiveness of a country. Although Spain has made significant progress in the educational level of its population in the last fifty years, even today remain two major problems: a high deficit of training in the international context and large educational disparities between regions. Territorial differences are linked, among other factors, to the gradual decentralization of the education system in our country in recent decades. The Spanish educational neglect is a structural problem that can hinder both accesses to the labor market of young people as their own job stability, with the risk of economic and social exclusion. This scenario makes the acquisition of compulsory education levels is a necessary but not sufficient condition, as required also continue post-compulsory education for better opportunities. In addition, the education system must not only transmit knowledge, but also other skills that foster innovation and creativity, preparing students for a complex and changing future. Among the indicators related to school failure, we will focus on early school leaving, which is measured by the percentage of people aged 18 to 24 who are outside the education system or have not completed compulsory education. It is considered that this indicator is best to carry out international comparisons because of its homogeneity. Making a comparison between the countries of the European Union-28, it draws attention to the position of Spain, which has the highest rate of early school leavers despite having an intermediate level of income. The persistence of this educational problem in Spain, which has maintained dropout rates at very high levels, around 30% for 10 years, is related to the economic and employment situation experienced by the country during the last economic boom phase (1995-2007). In that period Spain had significant growth mainly driven by the construction sector and especially among the male group. At that stage, many students left school without completing compulsory education to work in real estate. In addition to the impact of the construction sector, frequent changes in education laws, especially the change introduced by the LOGSE, which raised the number of years of compulsory education and established a more rigid curriculum. Although the dropout remains high, since the beginning of the economic crisis is shrinking due mainly to two factors. First, the measures taken by the government through programs aimed specifically at combating failure, and secondly, the economic crisis that has hit the construction sector. The presence of dropout affects unevenly the Spanish regions and has also been different behavior. The Mediterranean and southern regions have a problem more pronounced than those of northern Spain failure, highlighting in particular Baleares in the first case and País Vasco as the best region. Although there are many factors related to the differences regions, one that stands out to explain this gap are the job prospects and the importance of some low-skilled sectors, such as tourism and construction, where they can locate people leaving school early. Therefore, insular and Mediterranean regions where there are more jobs of this type have higher rates of school dropouts. Another element appears to be influential is the educational level of the population. In this sense, the regions the proportion of people with higher education is higher, usually having less risk of students leave school early. The explanation for this is that when students are under the infuence of the best-educated adults, will find it easier to continue their studies, being more reluctant to leave school early. We should also mention the public expenditure on education or income level of the population by region. In terms of public spending, it has shown that regions have more resources for education have better educational indicators than those regions that spend less, while it is true that this factor alone does not explain the school failure. Considering now the per capita GDP, the regions with the lowest per capita income are more likely to have higher dropout rates. In short, school failure may be motivated by a lot of factors, among which the sectoral structure of the area, the ease of finding without higher for young degree work, the income level of the population, public investment in education, the importance of human capital or higher or lower rate of unemployment, and other more personal factors such as the innate ability of the individual which is more difficult to act. To raise the academic performance further impetus seems necessary both guidance and support programs and curricular diversification for those students with a greater personal difficulties, family or socioeconomic and therefore most at risk of school failure. These programs can promote educational equality and motivate students more likely to dropout, usually directing their training and interests to the subsequent realization of a course of vocational training to open the doors to the world of work them. It is important that the measures to strengthen and expand begin from early childhood education, as educational delay symptoms are detected. Support activities may be more effective during the early years of teaching at older ages, when these deficiencies are already settled in the student; therefore, we must establish preventive measures to try to avoid educational failure. For this it is necessary to intensify efforts towards personalized assistance to help identify potential learning problems and provide both educational support and personal, especially those groups with the worst social and economic situation, especially focusing on regions with higher dropout rates. In addition, it would be a proper familiarity with centers greater autonomy in regards to your organization and try to the best possible student diversity. Since students have different skills and abilities and have different family and socio-economic environments, it is important that schools try to develop and guide the characteristics of the students, a goal that may be achieved through greater fexibility to group. It could also help reduce the school drop a configuration of a more flexible curriculum during the years of compulsory education. This would be to offer several alternatives, so that students do not have to walk the same path during the ten years of this stage.","Construction; Early school leaving; Education law; Long-term growth; School failure","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014045097"

It involves addressing ways to institutionalize coordination, not only between different levels of government, but with the incorporation of social and private figures that will collectively form the plans and programs. The aim of this paper is to analyze ways in which the governance model can improve the coordination between metropolitan actors to plan and manage the development of the ZMVT. Planning and management are commonly conceived by the government as two unrelated tasks. Planning is considered to be useful for filling the political and administrative record for the benefit of immediate federal investments and, while management is useful for immediately increasing tax collection by applying rights in handing out permits, whereby sustainable metropolization and social participation are in the background. The metropolitan phenomenon arose in Mexico in 1940, but it was not until the 1970s that urban, and not metropolitan, planning was regulated; this left uncertainty regarding the functions of metropolitan actors. The lack of coordination between them has thrown the metropolitan area into a crisis on at least three significant dimensions: economic, social and environmental. This has been found by analyzing political institutions in urban and metropolitan areas in Mexico, where the weak role of the State in planning and management is limited and mainly normative. While since 1970 the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Toluca has shown development based on industrialization and the a set of diversified services of regional impact, it was not until 2005 that the Executive Board of Metropolitan Coordination in the Valley of Toluca (CECMVT) emerged as a metropolitan response, focusing on the difficulties of coordination between metropolitan actors, but has failed to form an integrated vision of metropolitan development, leaving its action in the political will. The analysis methodology presented in this article is derived from the ratio of two phenomena: the first one is the role of the State in the metropolitan area, and second is the consolidation of its political status to plan and manage metropolitan development. Both phenomena should be part of the State Reform and be linked, on the one hand to the process of governance and, second, to the transformation of metropolitan public policy. The reform of the State of Mexico is the result of analyzing concepts related to governance, planning and management, because the reality of the country, and particularly that of the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Toluca, faces many fundamental issues that do not coincide with political discourse, including the following: 1. The problems of marginalization and poverty that have deepened in the countryside and that are emerging in major urban areas of the metropolitan area. 2. Excessive centralization of the State, which performs planning and management tools from a vertical and authoritarian perspective. 3. The lack of coordination between metropolitan actors. 4. The evident economic, social and environmental crisis in much of the country and pointedly in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Toluca. The emergence of such problems has turned them into permanent evils. Social pressure on the government is the product of the belief that fundamental change is required in the political and social institutions that make up the political regime. Moreover, the development policies in force from the beginning of the 1910s have become structurally dependent on the economic model and, consequently, focus on objectives such as infrastructure and regional equipment, undoubtedly essential to the modernization of the metropolitan area, but overcoming the facts of democracy, land use and environmental sustainability. As main results, we find that the planning and management of metropolitan development lack a basic territorial governance model, as agencies for this purpose have been restricted to the political will, only perceiving a broad relationship between government and investors without clear opportunities for the participation of civil society. In many cases, the CECMVT promotes investments and tools that have been applied at all costs, seriously affecting the social fabric, the territory and the environment. In the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Toluca, the inclusion of actors other that the government, in defense of their natural resources and against authoritarian metropolitan projects promoted by the State, has allowed us to assume that the metropolitan policy, in which systems of metropolitan actors interact, is no longer a space monopolized by state public institutions, as they have lost strength in favor of local actors, focusing only on the strategy of 'not doing and letting go'. As a main conclusion, uncoordinated metropolitan planning and management of metropolitan development actors result in a very dynamic process of concentration of economic activities, construction of regional infrastructure and population concentration, seriously affecting the environment and natural resources due to the ineffectiveness of government actions to control and guide such a process. The crisis of the metropolitan area is the result of decisions made by investors, who largely planned land uses through the market. This process has increased the pressure to swap the use of agricultural forestry land for urban land. After analyzing the behavior of the social, economic, and environmental dimensions, the following was observed: 1. In metropolitan terms, it is notable how in most municipalities in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Toluca, change in land use is sought from rural to urban without any clear signal on the part of the government that it will act accordingly. By 2010, several municipalities increased developable area above the current urban area (Almoloya de Juárez, Calimaya, Capulhuac and Mexicaltzingo), at least doubling in all cases the existing urban area without population justification. ""As an example, the growth of Almoloya de Juárez in at least 300 years doubles in less that 20"" (Cfr. GEM, 2011). 2. In social terms, it is surprising how the larger population growth between 2005 and 2010 occurred in small municipalities (San Antonio la Isla with 93.3% and Chapultepec with 47.9%), but we can also see, at the level of the metropolitan region in the rest of the peripheral and rural municipalities, the following: Xalatlaco 34.7%, Lerma 28%, Zinacantepec 25.1%, Calimaya 22%, Almoloya de Juárez 19.9%, Rayón 17.3%, Temaya 16.5%, Otzolotepec 16.2% and Tenango del Valle 15.9%. This was due to increased regional road infrastructure and permissiveness for formal and informal settlements to appear anywhere, resulting in the construction of such housing in those municipalities because of the availability of developable land at low prices as a result of their distance from the metropolitan center. 3. In economic terms, the metropolitan municipalities have specialized in the tertiary sector, followed by the secondary sector and lastly the primary sector. Socio-spatially, the result is a very dynamic process of concentration of economic activities, construction of regional infrastructure and concentration of population, severely affecting the environment and natural resources due to the inefficiency of government actions to control and guide metropolization. 4. In environmental terms, several of these peripheral municipalities (Temoaya, Lerma, Ocoyoacac, Tianguistenco, Tenango del Valle and Zinacantepec) have increased pressure for change in the use of forestland and agricultural to urban land. The paper therefore contributes to the strengthening of decentralized government agencies as opportunities for governance. The analysis of institutional and organizational conditions in force in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Toluca are relevant in addressing the challenges in response to the planning and management of metropolitan development. © 2015, Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia.

The application of a systemic perspective on the management of Biosphere Reserves is important to address the close relationships between the environmental and socio-economic processes and to take into account potential limiting factors, particularly evident in the case of insular arid systems as the Fuerteventura Biosphere Reserve (FBR), (Canary Islands). The tourist development on the island is leading to increasing land dedicated to anthropogenic uses, which is emphasizing the vulnerability of this system to other processes such as overgrazing and degradation of natural habitats that host numerous endangered species. In order to elaborate a tool which contributes to a more balanced and multifunctional development of the insular biosphere reserves, a dynamic model for FBR has been developed, structured in 5 model sectors: land use, biodiversity conservation, water resources, environmental quality and socio-touristic. The model, calibrated with data of the 1996-2011 period, integrates a set of 30 sustainability indicators to monitor their changes and interactions in the FBR over time. Results regarding comparison between observed and simulated values and the verification tests applied showed that the model is able to match the behaviour of this socio-ecological system. This decision-support tool allows analyzing the recent changes and trade-offs between the main environmental factors and indicators, thereby facilitating a management aimed to minimize those trade-offs and reinforce sustainable development policies in the Reserve. © 2013 Los Autores.

For that purpose it is important to analyse both the activities around this new way of developing economic activities and the business models used in practice. Based on American legal doctrine and experience, this analysis allows to understand the concept of collaborative economy which serves as a basis for the European Union survey in this field, e.g. the A European agenda for the collaborative economy drafted by the Commission. Furthermore, the revision of this concept enables to differentiate two ways of developing and implementing collaborative economy activities: Those considered as general or traditional (despite it being a recent phenomenon), represented by the so-called ""platform capitalism"", and those being more innovative and respectful with the adjective ""collaborative"", used to define this new ""economy"". The latter focuses on platform cooperativism and connects collaborative economy with social economy. The article is structured into two parts. The first one comprehends the study of the collaborative economy phenomenon. The second part explores the relationship between the social and collaborative economy, focusing on the role of the cooperative society as the owner of digital platforms. Collaborative economy exists because of the possibility of connecting people and/or assets through Internet. The digital technology has facilitated the access to those tangible and intangible assets which remained unused. Digital platforms have built up the required trust to describe the collaborative economy as open, inclusive and global. The core activities of the collaborative economy are: Collaborative consumption, which provides access to goods and / or services; collaborative production, in which groups, networks or individuals collaborate to design, produce or distribute goods; collaborative learning, open to any subject whith resources and knowledge shared to learn together; and collaborative finance, where loan or investment services are provided outside traditional financial institutions. New mechanisms for collaborative governance have recently also been included. Not to be confused with, different business models arisen out of this new way of organising economy. In our opinion, the business model will be determined by the type of activity performed by the platform regarding the provision of goods or services. Thus, the platform can act as a digital intermediary which connects suppliers and providers with users and facilitates their transactions. However, the platform can also act as a supplier of either the main product or service or supporting products or services. Only case-study will determine the business model and the legal framework which is applicable. The European Commission defines collaborative economy models as ""business models where collaborative platforms facilitate activities creating an open marketplace for the temporary usage of goods or services often provided by private individuals"". These business models involve service providers either sharing assets, resources, time and / or skills and who may be either private individuals offering services on an occasional basis (""peers"") or acting on a professional basis (""professional service providers""); the users of those services; and the intermediaries which connect providers with users and facilitate the transactions between them through an online platform (""collaborative platforms""). The way in which public opinion perceives the collaborative economy varies significantly. Many studies suggest that the collaborative economy does not have anything to do with the adjective ""collaborative"" since platforms do not share, neither the property, nor the benefits with the users, those who really generate value within them. As a consequence of this, a new movement has emerged aimed at returning to the roots of collaboration and creating platforms in which ownership, profit and responsibility are truly distributed: This is the case of the platform cooperativism. American authors were the pioneers in surveying the relationship between co-operatives and collaborative economy. They concluded that the platforms owned by those who have really generated their value allow for a fairer distribution of the added value, create solidarity links among workers, and fights against the on-demand jobs. The debate is currently focused on how to turn collaborative economy companies into cooperatives, meaningless transformation as many examples of cooperative platforms set up by cooperatives have been encountered. The link between Cooperatives and the collaborative economy has also been underlined in some documents of the European Institutions. However, some issues such as the benefits of their interaction, or the use of the cooperative social form to avoid the risks of collaborative economy are issues which have not been explored yet. These options have been analyzed in two recent studies carried out by private entities. The first one, promoted by the Unipolis Foundation and Legacoop, analyses the convergence between cooperatives and the collaborative economy in Italy. The second study has been promoted by Cooperatives Europe and analyses a similar issue at a European level. The added value in cooperative platforms is generated by both, the members-suppliers and the members-users. Their effort is to be rewarded through cooperative returns. The cooperative platform faces the same problems as any other cooperative, especially in terms of funding. Although, the cooperative philosophy is an advantage, as it contributes to turn collaborative economy into something truly collaborative for suppliers and users. From a methodological approach, the most relevant legal doctrine on collaborative economy (mostly US-produced) has been reviewed, as well as the working documents and initiatives of the European Institutions. Particular attention has been given to the studies analysing the relationship between the collaborative economy and the social economy. The article offers, as a result, a consistent description of this new reality and the opening towards a new field of study with a focus on the cooperative. From a legal approach, collaborative economy cannot be analysed as a whole. It involves many aspects and affects different sectors of the legal framework of each State. The study of the economic and legal issues included in the concept of ""sharing economy"" in the United States has helped to detect convergencies and differences with the economic and legal situation of the collaborative economy in Europe. As a consequence of this research it can be concluded that European States show a higher level of legal certainty and a better protection of the rights of users and providers/suppliers of goods and services. Moreover, the most recent studies on the links between the collaborative economy and the social economy have been carried out within the European framework, influenced by American research. All these studies have shown interesting examples of cooperatives owners of collaborative platforms. The main results of this research can be summarized as follows: The analysis of the different denominations of the collaborative economy and the different business models involved, the European approach to this new economy and the difference between organising collaborative economy in a capitalist or a cooperative way. The European agenda for the collaborative economy, launched by the European Commission in June 2016, shows that the collaborative economy and its agents have a secure regulatory framework in several European Directives, which contrasts with the general absence of regulation evidenced in the United States. Nonetheless, Europe and USA need to make some progress on fiscal and labour matters. These advances are intended to avoid situations of unfair competition between traditional businesses and the collaborative economy.","Collaborative economy; Collaborative platforms; Platform capitalism; Platform cooperativism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011585227"

Agriculture subsidies, tax incentives, and conservation easements have been successfully used as tools to convert cropland to native vegetation. However, uncertain economies threaten the sustainability of these incentives. The wildlife management profession is in need of innovative models that support effective management of populations. I argue that biologists should consider the option of facilitating the development of private reserves to reduce the dependence of conservation on public investment. Private reserves can be enhanced by creating common- interest communities, which reduce the problem posed by limited size of individual properties. Cross-property agreements between landowners can provide economic incentives through forms of ecotourism, energy production, and/or enhanced agricultural production. I share two case studies that demonstrate how cross-property agreements may be beneficial to landowner's finances and conservation of diverse wildlife communities, as well as providing an efficient structure for NGOs and management agencies to engage and support landowners. © 2012 Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona.","Conservancy; Conservation biology; Economics; Landscape; Policy; Private lands","community resource management; conservation management; ecotourism; landowner; nature reserve; nongovernmental organization; participatory approach; private land; sustainability; wildlife management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871328058"

This research paper establishes the theoretically based relationships between eco-innovation activities, -as a way of achieving the Smart Specialization Strategy label-, and competitiveness. the reference model has been the eco-innovation index provided by the eco-Innovation Observatory (EIO), a european Independent Institution asked by the european Commission to develop such and index, and its posterior application to the 27 members of the european Union. the eco-innovation concept includes all forms of innovation activities looking to improve outstandingly the environmental protection. this means: new production processes, new products or services, and new management and business methods (Kuehne, 2007). In a first step we have studied the eco-Innovation Observatory Index from a methodological point of view, considering the very statistical nature of the relevant variables, their explanatory power, their statistical features and properties and so on. the indicators of the eco-Innovation scoreboard are grouped into five thematic areas or blocks: i) eco-innovation inputs, ii) eco-innovation activities, iii) eco-innovation outputs, iv) environmental outcomes and, v) socio-economic outcomes. the scoreboard shows how well individual Member states perform in different dimensions of eco-innovation compared to the eU average and presents their strengths and weaknesses. we establish the existing relationship between eco-innovation and competitiveness by estimating a statistical model, which proves that reinforcing eco-innovation leads to improvements in competitiveness. According to the obtained relationship, what could be said about the Andalusian competitiveness derived from its eco-innovation activities? Unfortunately enough, the eco-innovation index is only provided by the eIO at national level. One of the challenges faced by this article is to cope with this difficulty. One of the main contributions of this study is the development of a pioneer methodology, enormously useful to build up an approach to the eco-innovation index for Andalusia. In this essay we could only consider three out of the five thematic areas considered in the EIO Index. we couldńt obtain the 16 requested variables or single indicators from any official institution, but only 5 of them instead. nevertheless, multivariate statistical methods applied to this set of indicators or variables let us conclude that the three thematic areas account for a 65% of the explanatory value of the scoreboard (see álvarez, Fernández y Romera, 2014). With the available information we recalculate our ""partial"" scoreboard for the 27 european Union countries, i.e., five variables belonging to three thematic areas. then, we are able to compare Andalusia with the partial spanish scoreboard and we have also estimated the Andalusian relative position in the european Union scene. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic article that tries to locate the Andalusian eco-innovation scoreboard in the european eco-innovation map. Is such Andalusian eco-innovation scoreboard closer to those of the most eco-innovative countries in the european Union? Cluster analysis and Multidimensional scaling analysis are some of the tools that we have used to figure out the likely position of this region as compared to the different european eco-innovation levels. Ideally, the suggested mapping would allow to benchmark eventual european perceivers of structural Funds. The accuracy, reliability and availability of the data used in the study have brought into the fore the convenience of updating the regional eco-innovation Database as is the case for Andalusia. As a further research to improve the yields of this preliminary study we find out that there is an urgent need to develop better regional eco-innovation measures.","Andalusia; Cluster Analysis; Eco-innovation; European Union; Multidimensional scaling Analysis; RIs3; Smart specialization strategies; Sustainable development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921461583"

In this regard, the necessary guidance to the integral sustainability of these protected areas requires planning tools ordered, regulated and properly managed nature sports that make up what we call in Spain as "" active tourism "" (""tourisme sportif de nature"" in francophone literature or ""nature sport tourism"" and ""outdoors sports"" in anglo-saxon bibliography), whose major development in recent decades is representing the appearance of environmental impacts, land use conflicts and problems, particularly in the field of natural parks, which are the territory support and living environment most requested by practitioners of these activities and the companies and agents that offer commercially.

And in the same vein, there have also been studied with critical view other rules of the Regional Administration to define more generally the system of planning and management of uses and activities in these natural parks as well as the measures and instruments on administrative authorizations thereof. Finally, we have sought the views of the various agents of nature sports as sports federations and non-profit associations that integrate a large number of users as well as own companies or brokers that offer of nature sports in these natural parks, all with the aim of detecting problems, dysfunctions and difficulties of applicability of the rules of these sports in protected natural areas in Andalusia.

Different economic scenarios were considered with variations from revenues coming from timber sales, payment of environmental services (PES) by the Costa Rican government, and sales of emission reduction certificates. Forestry activities were analyzed in the context of other alternative uses such as cattle, bananas and pineapple plantations. The investment analysis was performed taking into account the land expectation value (VET) with annual minimum acceptable discount rates in real terms (TMA) of 9%, 6% and 3%, which reflected different investor preferences and conditions. For plantation forestry and secondary forest with and without intensive management, estimated average investment were US$5200, US$1730 y US$1373 ha-1, respectively. Timber revenues were above US$21142 ha-1 for both species under plantation forestry. Secondary forest revenues were US$1250 and US$13408 ha-1 for secondary forest with low and intensive management, respectively. CER and PSA represented marginal quantities compared with timber revenues. Pineapple and banana plantations are land uses with the highest economic efficiency, followed by forest plantations. Cattle-raising and secondary forest with and without management are not only the least profitable land uses but also their calculated values are below the land price. Forest restoration will not become an acceptable economic activity for a landowner that relies on income generated from environmental services and carbon credits at current prices. High timber prices and low discount rates (desirable macroeconomic conditions) are determining factors in achieving efficient and sustainable investments in forestry activities in the Caribbean region of Costa Rica. © 2012 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre.

At the beginning of the twenty-first century a new set of rural transformation processes involving new and old actors are taking place in the continent. This generates conflicts and alliances with implications for the design and implementation of agri-food policies and poverty reduction. The agrarian questions of the 21st century are currently linked to two main land and territorial grabbing processes: on the one hand, those linked to agribusinesses for the production of multiple use crops (e.g. soy, sugar cane, oil palm, corn, etc.); and, on the other hand, those linked to extractive firms (e.g. oil, mines, bio-energy, wood, etc.). The two processes are connected, however, to others with a longer time span, which continue taking place in parallel: those linked to family farms partially related to; those related to diversified rural producers; and, finally, those related to «peasant» populations and/or ethnic groups totally or partially excluded from the markets. The main goal of this paper is to identify the characteristics assumed by each process in the countries of the region; and, from a normative perspective, to outline what policies should be designed and implemented for overcoming rural poverty, food security and food sovereignty, and an economic growth respectful of natural ecological processes in this new context. © 2015, Agroalimentaria.

These issues concern on the one hand, the non-recognition by Morocco of Spanish sovereignty over the Cities, Islands and Rocks in North of Africa; and on the otherhand, Spain's planned implementation of the Marine Strategy in Melilla, in a maritime area not reflected in the national legislation. This should force a bilateral cooperation on environmental issues within the framework of existing international agreements. Through the adoption of Law 41/2010, on marine environmental protection, Spain has proceeded with the transposition into its national legal framework the European Marine Strategy (Framework Directive 2008/56/EC). Following the same parameters as the Framework Directive, Law 41/2010 ultimate objective is the establishment of a ""good environmental status"" by 2020. Furthermore, the Law clearly defines the terms ""Marine Strategy"", ""Environmental Objectives"" and ""Programs of Measures"" among others. It also simplifies the regulation of the various phases established for achieving the marine strategies, such as the following: 1. - Initial assessment of the state of the marine environment; 2. - Determination of good environmental status; 3. - Establishment of environmental objectives; 4. - Establishment of a monitoring program; 5. - Development and implementation of a program of measures to achieve a good environmental status. These phases are completed with the provisions of the 4th Additional Provision, which includes a timetable for the development and implementation of these strategies. The strategies adopted should reinforce other measures taken in regional treaties, such as the Convention for the Protection of Marine Environment of the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean (Barcelona Convention). Moreover, and in accordance with the principle of flexibility in the development of marine strategies, consistency should be ensured with a number of procedural principles and planning criteria such as the precautionary principle, the ecosystem approach, legal requirements, sustainable development, preventive action, rectifying environmental damage at source and that the polluter should pay. Also, Law 41/2010, as well as the European Marine Strategy, foresees the need for cooperation with other States when sharing the same marine region. Law 41/2010 states that the strategies are to cover the Territorial Sea, the Exclusive Economic Zone, Continental Shelf and Ecological or Fisheries Protected Areas, as well as ""coastal waters"" if not already protected by the Water legislation. In addition, the Law creates the concept of ""demarcación marina"", corresponding to each of the five created, a marine strategy. These ""demarcations"" correspond to the marine environment over which Spain has sovereignty or jurisdiction, in the following geographical areas: a) North Atlantic Marine Demarcation; b) South Atlantic Marine Demarcation; c) East-Balearic Marine Demarcation; d) Canary islands Marine Demarcation; e) Estrecho de Gibraltar - Alborán Marine Demarcation. The Marine Demarcation ""Estrecho de Gibraltar-Alborán"" includes the marine environment over which Spain has sovereignty or jurisdiction in the area of Ceuta, Melilla, Chafarinas Islands, the rock of Perejil, Vélez de la Gomera and Alhucemas and the island of Alboran. This last reference to the islands and rocks over which Spain has sovereignty or jurisdiction in North Africa represents an exceptional legal support to Spanish claims of sovereignty over these territories. Also, it's the first time that Perejil rock is referred to in the Spanish legal system.The demarcation ""Estrecho de Gibraltar-Alborán"" necessarily implies, in the light of of Spanish and European laws, a partnership with Morocco when developing marine strategies. However, this is also unlikely to succeed, because there is no maritime boundaries delimitation agreement between the two countries. This is the con sequence of the territorial claim by Morocco of cities, islands and rocks of Spanish sovereignty in northern Africa, which led Morocco to close its Mediterranean shores with straight baselines, locking or even misusing Spanish territories in support to its violation of General International Law. Currently, the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment has published the documents related to the ""Marine Strategies, Initial Assessment, Good environment and environmental objectives"" - These documents have been subject to public consultation on the website of the Ministry. In the section on ""bi-tri-lateral meetings"" within the the framework of the Strategy document, there is no reference to Morocco nor to any meeting held by Spain with other neighboring countries.. Neither does it refer to these meetings in the Strategy for the Estrecho de Gibraltar-Alboran. According to this document by the Ministry, in the case of Melilla, the strategy would affect a portion of water, understood as Territorial Sea starting from the normal baselines, that is the low-water line along the coast. This interpretation would be the strict application of international and Spanish (Law 10/1977) legal framework. The Territorial Sea will extend seaward until the end of the EEZ of Morocco, and from drawing two parallel lines based on land boundaries, north and south, of the city of Melilla. In fact, there is a confidential Nautical Chart prepared by the Spanish Marine Hydrographic Institute in which are reflected these water coordinates called ""Jurisdictional Waters"" (Territorial Sea). Spain has never made public or official this Waters. For the purpose of protecting the marine environment and the implementation of the European Marine Strategy in the city of Melilla, we consider that there's a need for practical arrangements between the two States and forgetting any claim of sovereignty. Since the environment is a Good (asset) shared by all States. Hence, there are international legal texts that would allow such cooperation. Firstly, the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty between Spain and Morocco of 1991, refers to respect for international law, territorial integrity of states and the non-use of force between the parties. Secondly, there is the bilateral agreement on environmental cooperation, of 2000, which could serve as the legal basis for the implementation of the Marine Strategy for Marine Demarcation ""Estrecho de Gibraltar-Alborán"" through the exchange of information, opinions and suggestions and technical assistance. The whole legal package could be placed under the supervision of a Joint Monitoring Committee. Moreover, the Barcelona Convention to which both States are parties, gives the possibility of concluding bilateral agreements and establish the general obligation to protect the environment and contribute to sustainable development. Finally, within the EU, the Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Morocco, of 2000, provides for cooperation in the areas including monitoring and preventing pollution of the sea. And in the EU-Morocco Action Plan implementing the advanced status of 2013, the promotion and protection of the marine environment are expected, including conservation of marine ecosystems and the increase of cooperation under the Barcelona Convention and its protocols. In summary, our opinion is that there are adequate legal instruments to achieve a good environmental status in the city of Melilla. This is possible through practical cooperation between Morocco and Spain and without affecting sovereignty claims, and always with a serious political will of both countries. Environment, and the Marine Environment, is a Good shared by the entire International Community.","European marine strategy; Marine environment; Melilla; Morocco","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923320015"

In order to reassure the financial markets, the modification of the constitutional framework essentially sought to strengthen the commitment to the two major restrictions directly imposed by European Union law on the budgetary policy of Member States: limitations on both the deficit and the total volume of public debt. And yet, the real potential of new Article 135 goes beyond the mere ratification of the demands of fiscal discipline imposed by Brussels. Thereby, on the one hand, it enables the Central Government to set by organic law the maximum permitted structural deficit for both the State and the Autonomous Communities. The only condition to be met when setting the deficit level is not to exceed the thresholds stipulated, if applicable, by the European Union (Article 135.2 of the Spanish Constitution). On the other hand, it allows to fill constitutional gaps that had so far hindered the effective enforcement of such discipline to all administrations by Central Government authorities. Thus, the Spanish fiscal stability legislation existing prior to the reform lacked a feature deemed to be essential to set up a truly effective fiscal rule, namely, a mechanism of credible sanctions. This explains the extent to which the central legislature is right now empowered to regulate the matter: the Article 135.5 of the Constitution specifies those materialareas that the Organic Law ""shall, in any event, regulate"". Among these areas, the following are included: ""the way and term in which the possible deviations over one or other ceiling [the deficit and debt limits] shall be corrected"" (a); and ""the liability of each Public Administration in the event of a breach of budgetary stability targets"" (c). In short, this constitutional reform lays the groundwork for the extension of the catalogue of measures (necessarily restrictive for financial independence) that the State can undertake in order to ensure compliance with both the deficit and debt limits by the Autonomous Communities and Local Authorities. There is no doubt that the central legislature has made the most of the generous empowerment conferred by the reformed Article 135 of the Spanish Constitution. Hence, the Organic Law 2/2012 on Fiscal Stability and Financial Sustainability has set up an array of instruments of control in benefit of central power which, due both to its intensity and extension, has no equal in decentralized neighboring countries. Suffice it to mention the main supervisory measures and sanctions provided for in this respect. To begin with, this Act requires that, within the term of fifteen days from non-compliance ocurring, the Administration in breach of the stability targets has to approve the freezing of credits and implement the corresponding withholding of credit ""to guarantee compliance with the target set"" [Article 25.1 a) ]. On the other hand, it includes various financial sanctions in line with the already known traditional ones in European legislation [Article 25.1 b)]: the non-complying Autonomous Community is obliged to lodge an interest bearing deposit in the Bank of Spain equivalent to 0.2% of its GDP. Should the appropriate measures to ensure compliance with the targets be adopted, the deposit will be cancelled. Otherwise, within a period of three months, the deposit will cease to generate interest and if, following a further three-month period, no measures are implemented, ""it may be decided to convert the deposit into a coercive fine"".In addition, the Organic Law 2/2012 modifies the regime applicable to devolded taxes envisaged in the Organic Law of Finance of Autonomous Communities. Namely, the regulatory powers vouchsafed to the Autonomous Communities regarding devolded taxes will be exercised by the State [Article 25. 1 a) last line]. The next step in the control/sanction system contained in Chapter IV of the Organic Law 2/2012 consists in the dispatch by the Government of ""a commission of experts to assess the economic and budgetary situation of the administration concerned"". The functions and powers attributed to this commission are not negligible. Firstly, ""this commission may request, and the administration concerned shall be obliged to furnish, any data, information or background regarding items of revenue and expenditure"". In line with this principle, the possibility that the Central Administration is able not only to request information from the distance to the Sub-central Government, but it is endowed also to get it in situ within this Sub-central Administration, is not entirely unknown in the neighboring federal states. This is the case in Germany, where the Article 84.3 of the Bonn Basic Law specifically provides that the Federal Government send commissioners to the Länder to check that federal laws are implemented in accordance with the law in force. Furthermore, it is widely understood that these commissioners are endowed with powers of investigation and inspection, including the examination of dossiers. However, in the German case, the general rule is that of the ""imperviousness "" of the Länder Administrations, in such a way that the dispatch is only possible with regards to the ""highest authorities of the Land"" (governmental level). The intervention of the commissioners regarding the ""subordinate authorities"" (officials or other type of position holders) is deemed to be exceptional given that it requires the consent of the highest authorities of the Land or, this consent lacking, the approval of the Bundesrat. On the contrary, the terms of Article 25.2 of the Organic Law 2/2012 seem neither to exclude that the ""commission of experts"" might enter into relations with intermediate positions holders of the Autonomous Communities, nor that the State might extend its power of carrying out inspections to the various centres or services linked to the Autonomous Communities Administration, facilitating thereby a particularly intense interference in the regional sphere. But this is certainly not the main problem posed by the regulation of this commission of experts. Besides these powers in the information field, this commission is vested with the following attributions: ""the commission must submit a proposal of measures, and its conclusions shall be made public within one week. The measures proposed shall be binding upon the non-complying administration"". The wording of the Organic Law entails a real decision-making power for the commission over those Regional Governments supervised. The constitutional adequacy of this power is more than doubtful. Nonetheless, the Constitutional Court has saved by interpretative via the constitutionality of the provision, considering that it is to be understood as meaning that the decisions to be taken by the commission of experts have no binding legal effect (STC 215/2014, FJ 7°). Finally, by virtue of Article 155 of the Constitution (Article 26), the institution of federal coercion brings to an end the set of coercive measures provided for in the Organic Law 2/2012 concerning the Autonomous Communities. This institution is conceived as a true decentralization system shutdown clause, as it is designed to operate in extreme crisis situations (essentially: failure to comply with the constitutional obligations), since it allows the Government, following the approval granted by an absolute majority of the Senate, to issue instructions to all the authorities of the non-complying Autonomous Community. This scheme originally planned by the central legislature has only be hardened thereafter. The principle of financial sustainability was conceived in the original version of the Law of Fiscal Stability as ""the capacity to finance present and future spending commitments within the limits of the deficit and public debt"" (Article 4.2). Following the reform of this Act stemming from the Organic Law 9/2013, this principle has been extended to the ""late payment of commercial debt"". Thereby, commercial debt directly becomes a substantive element of the system of fiscal discipline imposed on the Autonomous Communities by the central legislature. Consequently, this kind of debt further entails the activation of a set of supervisory, controlling and sanctioning powers granted to the State over the Autonomous Communities. Moreover, it constitutes an extension of fiscal discipline that is of dubious constitutionality given that Article 135 of the Constitution is limited to financial debts. But while the Constitutional Court had not taken a decision concerning this issue, the late payment of commercial debt can result in the implementation of the coercive measures envisaged in the event of non-compliance with the deficit and debt limits. Those measures are: the freeze on credits; the exercise by the State of the regulatory powers concerning devolved taxes; the deposit in the Bank of Spain; and the dispatch of the ""commission of experts"" to the Autonomous Community concerned.","Balanced budget rule; Fiscal discipline; Fiscal federalism; Intergovernmental relations; Public debt","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976885351"

In this complex situation it is necessary to understand the efficiency and viability of these systems in the province of La Pampa (Argentina). Random stratified sampling was carried out per department with proportional allotment and 47 producers were interviewed, representing 27 % of the producers in the Pampa basin. Milk production (MP, L year-1) was modelled with regards to the size of the herd in number of milking cows (MC) and concentrate intake (CONI, kg MC-1 d-1). Through parametric techniques, an average technical efficiency of 35 % was estimated and three levels of efficiency were established through the interval (x-1/2S, x+1/2S). Later, through single-factor variance techniques of fixed effects the variables that explain differences based on the level of efficiency were determined: size, productivity, percentage of permanent grasslands, use of supplements, labor productivity and degree of diversification of farms.

How could we identify such goods? Which guidelines or guiding principles would guide our search? With what terms could we refer to the new category? APPROACH The Economy for the Common Good (ECG) was formulated by Felber in 2010. We will develop our proposal within this general theoretical/reflexive framework. After synthesizing their core lines, we analyze their possible repercussions as a model of political economy and pay attention to their role as a vector for domesticating, eroding, and finally transcending the capitalist ways and practices and the serious imbalances it causes. We start from Communities for the Common Good, as civil society entities, that manage a small set of assets in community that assures them resilience: guaranteeing more autonomy, self-sufficiency and own initiative; at the same time as less dependence on other instances like market or State, with their unsecured wages or their subsidies. Resilience truly represents and constitutes the helm in advancing our purpose: communities for the common good must be unequivocally resilient communities. Common sense quickly gives us the list of indispensable goods, of which we daily face a massive and continuous consumption: housing, food, clothing, mobility and electric and internet access bills. We leave aside common sense pre-notions to proceed, as Bourdieu explains, to the epistemological break with which to be able to achieve them in a more rigorous and scientific way. We propose to approach this rupture through four ways: 1. The sociohistorical way involves a journey through the Humanity's greatest socio-cultural transformations. It is a History of Great Changes within the evolution of human culture, paying attention to the goods that have had a vital and foundational character during the journey, marking each of the moments of transformation (discontinuities) between each historical or cultural continuity and its immediately subsequent. There are four discontinuities we identify as fundamental: a) the passage from Paleolithic to Neolithic, with the discovery of agriculture that made possible the first settlements, which we update operationally as homes or housing. b) the transition from Neolithic to complex societies (Mesopotamia, Nile Valley, Indus Valley) characterized by the incorporation of irrigation systems that multiplied agricultural production, forcing the need for a graphic system for accounting, which will later become more complex as a writing system. c) the passage from complex societies to industrial society. The large quantity and density of energy that allowed the massive and systematic use of fossil fuels and their ability to vectorize themselves to promote mobility play the same role as agriculture, housing and water distribution had played in the two previous discontinuities. d) the transition from industrial society to network society. A leap that is marked by the emergence of internet with all its potential in terms of massive intercommunication between peers in the network, revolutionizing the economic modes of production (3D printing) distribution (peer-topeer) and consumption (collaborative economy). The goods that have functioned as triggers of these great transformations, properly establishing themselves as the material conditions of possibility of these human realizations, currently provide the material conditions of human subsistence and dignity according to the civilizing paradigm that is taken into account as life context. On them lies resilience of civil society as such; when the communities of which it is composed are empowered with the control, leadership and management of these resources. Putting together all the stages studied we obtain six sectors, which for all above can be called foundational goods: housing, agroecology, water, energy, mobility and the internet. 2. The economic path is another channel towards the new category that we aim to achieve. The broad field of commons ?communal assets from ECG's perspective? is already consolidated after Elinor Ostrom's laureate works. We recognize its importance in setting up a format for community ownership. Civil economy and basic needs economy are theories that complete the essential axes to concretize the premises in order to justify the incorporation of civil society in the framework of the economic management modes. They can be called community goods: the asets to be managed through this type of community-based property. 3. The political path begins with the awareness of the scarce institutionalization and functionality of civil society, to which is added the hitherto unknown knowledge of the role of communities in the whole of an Economy for the Common Good, as the subject on whom all possibility and responsibility for social or community resilience lies. When civil society organizes itself for the management of these goods, it elevates itself as the third pillar -along with the market and the State- of social order, expanding the space of political possibilities as it opens the door to governance relations. The main character to be enshrined by the new mode of management for the goods on which human dignity and subsistence depend, and hence its community resilience, is democracy. Now, from this perspective, we can call them democratic goods. 4. The juridical way aims first to raise awareness of the relationship between the list of assets obtained by the development of previous channels of analysis and the realization of human rights, thus pointing to the establishment of economic rights. Secondly, he stresses the importance of extending to the economic order the division principle that separates the fundamental right from the ordinary one in the legal order. In this way, the goods grouped in the previous lines of reasoning could be called as fundamental goods, or rather, by the legal place that would correspond to them, constituent goods. RESULTS/IMPLICATIONS Of the four possibilities that we have obtained for its denomination, namely: foundational, communitarian, democratic and constituent, the attribute of ""democratic"" is the only one that is in permanent revision. At any historical moment, the modes of practical management of asets may undergo changes that enable or improve, for example, collective intelligence flow, due to advances in technology. In that case, the format used for its management should be updated so that it always coincides with the one that offers the highest levels of codecision, democracy and transparency of its time. This need for constant updating is the reason why we are finally inclined to preferentially denominate them as democratic goods, although the other three denominations are perfectly compatible and acceptable. To facilitate the understanding of the concept, we offer a first formulation of its definition, along with some other important features. Each of Galtung's basic needs -survival, welfare, freedom and identity- suggests a paired function among the goods we have found. The last step (identity) allows the incorporation of health and education, closing the complete scheme of democratic goods with eight sectors, as shown at the end, on the last page. PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS AND ORIGINAL VALUE The Economy for the Common Good contains two nuclei for practical work -communal goods and communities- that allow us to progress substantially towards a new concept for the establishment of economic rights as part of universal rights. Although Felber's manual does not initially envisage a specific structure or function of its own for the communities, nor does it specify a certain format for the management of communal assets, those are, clearly, the active subject that is to manage the minimum package of indispensable goods, which we have called democratic goods. Communal goods provide the type of general management -with a marked non-specific character, as Ostrom argued- that is viable for a community. It is through the most democratic mechanisms, such as self-consumption and cooperation structures oriented to basic needs -democratic goods cooperatives, very similar in their operations to consumers cooperatives- how communities gain resilience. The substitution of oligopolies by self-organized communities in the most indispensable sectors also offers a landscape of remarkable reduction of the total carbon footprint of our civilization. In the calculation of the economy's decarbonization both direct and indirect effects should be added. The political and economic repercussions of democratic goods, managed as such, are not restricted to the environment, but rather enter into the already abundant discussion of the inclusion of universal basic income in our economic systems. A kind of management like the one proposed with this new concept immerses us in the possibilities of a basic income in resources, without prejudice to a possible complementation in currency, also softening some of its classic points of friction. © 2017 CIRIEC-España.","Basic human needs; Democratic goods; Economic rights; Urban commons","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030169687"

However, these changes have not occurred evenly among the different branches of economic activity or with the same form and intensity in different areas of the Spanish geography. This differential intensity with which the economic crisis has affected the companies located in different Spanish regions is the focus of the analisis of this article. Considering the regional perspective, any autonomous region remained safe from the financial-economic crisis, although the intensity of it is manifested unevenly. Actually the degree of economic deterioration in each one has been conditioned by their own characteristics and productive specialization Aim Therefore, the goal is to provide an approach to the regional geography of the economic crisis in Spain from the dynamic business location registered during the 2000-2013 period. The number of companies by region and its evolution before and during the crisis will be analyzed to show some characteristics related to how the business activity was organised into the regions (based in the sectoral composition, size and legal regime) and how and when these characteristics changed as a result of the bursting of the real estate bubble. Also, the relationship between the business dynamics and the evolution of the real economy of the regions analyzed, through the analysis of the bankruptcy proceedings and the evolution of regional GDP Methodology The database used is the Central Companies Directory (DIRCE), elaborated by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE). In order to analyze the business dynamics, we obtained the number of companies by year, region, sector of activity and legal regime, and we work them using simple and accumulated variation rates. We also estimate a model by GMM. In order to confirm the countercyclical nature of insolvency proceedings in relation to regional activity. This estimation is made with a panel of regional data for the period 2004-2013; with information collected from the Statistic of Bankruptcy Procedure and the Regional Accounting of Spain (also obtained from the Spanish Statistical Office). Main Results After registering positive rates of variation in the number of companies in all regions during the expansion phase (2000-2008), particularly emphasizing Murcia, Madrid and Extremadura above the average (with variations greater than 40%); in the 2008-2013 period, all regions experienced significant declines (Murcia, Basque Country and Valencia experimented a reduction during this period of more than 10% of existing companies in 2008). According to the legal regime five regions (Basque Country, Balearic Islands, Catalonia, Valencia and Andalusia) were the ones in which the largest reduction of the number of corporations was observed (above average which reached 14.61%). With regard to companies formed as limited partnerships, eight regions registered decreasing rates above 5% (well above the national average), although it is remarkable that six of them have increased these types of businesses. And for enterprises constituted as individuals the decline was widespread in all regions and in ten of them the reduction was even higher than the national average (-12.83%). As per the size, micro-business destruction by regions and provinces was generalized, with declines upper the national average (-6,51%) been registered in half of the provinces. The situation experienced by small businesses was even more negative (average destroying -34%) and generalized to all provinces, exceeding the national average decreasing rate in twenty-eight of them. For midsize businesses the deterioration (-26% of national average) also affected all provinces, in twenty-nine of them the reduction experienced was higher than national average, highlighting Ciudad Real, Teruel, Jaén, Cádiz, Málaga , Castellón and Toledo which rates reached 40%. However, the situation for large companies was different by provinces and regions, highlighting thirteen provinces where the number of large companies increased by more than 5%, moreover, twenty-four of them registered impairments above average (which reached - 16.63%), highlighting Teruel, Cádiz, Huesca and Santa Cruz de Tenerife with damage greater than 60%. Regarding the behavior of business dynamics by branch of economic activity in the 2008-2013 period, the number of manufacturing companies deeply deteriorated, destroying 20% of existing companies at the beginning of the crisis. In Cantabria, Catalonia, Andalusia, Madrid, Valencia and Murcia the destruction rate exceeded 20%. The deterioration in the construction sector was even more significant (-31.6% national average) and generalized to all regions highlighting the deep deterioration mainly in six regions (Murcia, Valencia, Castilla La Mancha, Andalusia, Cantabria and Catalonia, with destructions above the national average). There were also significant decreases in the number of transport and storage companies (-14%), professional and scientific activities (-7%) and trade (-6%), and they affected all regions. The financial intermediation and insurance business, despite the contraction of the economic cycle, experienced an increase of 7.8% of national average, increasing mor even in regions such as Castilla La Mancha, Extremadura, Madrid, Aragon, La Rioja, Andalusia and Valencia; there was only a slight deterioration in the Balearic and Canary Islands. In companies engaged in real estate activities the evolution was positive (9.67% of national average), higher than the national average in eleven regions (highlighting Galicia, Extremadura and La Rioja, with increases above 25%) and only contracted in four regions (Basque Country, Murcia, Canary Islands and Valencia). Synthesis We have found that the business dynamics at regional level is heterogeneous, distinguishing different patterns among them before and during the crisis. Based on the nature of legal regime, size and sector, we determined that the impact of the crisis in the 2008-2013 period have affected more strongly to certain types of companies. Finally, we confirm that the bankruptcy proceedings on regional scale is countercyclical, meaning that as the regional productive activity deteriorates it evolves positively; this correlation appears more clearly from 2008 to the beginning of the economic crisis, although in certain cases even though it has cushioned the fall of regional GDP, even recently registered a slight recovery, bankruptcy proceedings are still on an upward trend.","Bankruptcy proceedings; Business dynamics; Economic crisis; Spain; Territorial patterns","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009383594"

A report drafted by the European Environment Agency in 2009 forecast that between 1995 and 2025 the urbanised land area would increase from 55% to 73% of total land area in Europe. This urban-residential expansion has often been located along coastal areas, for example in Ireland, Portugal and above all in the Spanish Mediterranean. In the Spanish Mediterranean alone, in the period 1992-2000, over one million two hundred thousand new dwellings were built, increasing by close to five million more between 2001 and 2011, representing an increase of 25% in housing numbers. In the case of the province of Alicante (Spain), this territory between 1997 and 2008, ranked third in Spain in housing units built (345,410), after Madrid and Barcelona and ahead of provinces with larger populations such as Valencia or Málaga. This residential expansion has been accompanied by a change in the urban model. From a concentrated, it has moved towards low-density models (detached houses with a swimming pool and garden) and medium-density models (semi-detached houses) and, to a much lesser degree, to high-rise buildings (blocks of apartments). These later two types of urbanization are integrated into private developments with gardens and swimming pools. The diverse evolution of the urbanresidential land area between different regions will have repercussions on various aspects of the territory, such as consumption and demand for water because greater or lesser demand will be generated depending on the urbanization model. Methodology and Objectives The demand for water in urban spaces depends on a combination of different factors and components: population served (permanent and seasonal); city model (disperse or concentrated); number and types of households served (in blocks, detached, etc.); number of industries and activities developed; number of commercial premises; municipal consumption (gardens, street cleaning, schools and other public buildings, etc.). Besides, other decisive factors are the dynamism of the economy, pricing policies and, above all, the measures for managing and saving water in consumption habits. The aim of this paper is know which causes had been influenced this decrease. This decline is generalized in the rest of Spain and other development countries. We have conducted several interviews with the directors and technicians of the supply water companies. In this sense, it has been revealed that there are several causes that have affected a continuous decrease of water consumption. Four interviews were conducted at the headquarters of the company Hidraqua, Integrated Management of Aguas de Levante SA (Former Aquagest Levante), as this is the company that has facilities and transparency in providing concrete data and interviews. It should also be noted that this company is one of the most implementation is in the localities of the study area. This has yielded the expected results on the objectives and initial hypothesis and to know what the possible causes are and how they have affected the aggregate of falling consumption or urban and tourist water. Results According to the last dates in the inquest about suply and sanitation water in Spain, the average consumption in the Spanish dwellings in 2011 was 142 litres/inhabitant/day, 1.4% less than 2010. In the Valencian Community, where is localized the province of Alicante, in 2011 water consumption was 155 litres/inhabitant/day, the 3.2% less than the year before. In compare with other Spanish cities, for example, in the same year, water consumption was 133 litres/inhabitant/day in Madrid, 119 in Valencia or 116 in Barcelona. In the case of Alicante, water consumtpion per inhabitant and day is 119 litres in 2013. Noteworthy that there has been a decline of 22% since 2000. In this year water consumption per inhabitant and day was 150 litres. This reduction is similar in others cities in the Spanish Mediterranen. In this sense, in the towns on the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, there has been a decrease of 25% in fifteen years. If we compare others cities around the world, we can see that this consumption is higher than the Spanish towns. For example, in Jerusalem the average water consumption per inhabitant and day is 650 litres, in Sidney 206 litres, in Oslo 197 litres or London 154 litres. It is important to highlight the domestic water consumption decrease in other parts of the world. In California (USA) in 2014 water suppliers reported that consumption fell 11.5 percent in August compared with the year before. That was the first full month of mandatory restrictions and fines for water-wasters imposed by the State Water Resources Control Board in July. In this sense, Santa Cruz residents conserved far more than the state average as Santa Cruzans cut water use by 28 percent. Besides, the Governor of the State called on Californians to reduce water use by 20 percent when he declared a drought emergency in January. Californians could face further restrictions if the drought worsens and the coming winter fails to produce adequate snow and rainfall. The general dynamic of domestic water consumption decrease since the end of the nineties could be related to structural and conjunctural factors. This is due to a combination of interrelated causes, the following stand out as being the most significant determinants. One of these causes is the installation and generalization of water saving devices. For example, in plumbing systems and electrical appliances, great improvements in water consumption have been achieved. Savings of 40- 60% compared with conventional models have been made. Aerators and diffusers to reduce water consumption by 40% and the installation of WC cisterns with dual flush systems also constitute a saving of up to 50%. On top of this we can also add the gradual and permanent development of consumption habits aimed at saving water that have been growing in popularity since the middle of the last decade, and which have intensified even more as a result of the economic crisis from 2007 onwards. Conclusions A good understanding of factors that influence domestic water consumption is essential for developing and implementing appropriate policies with regard to this resource. Among these factors, prices and taxes have received considerable attention in the past, whereas demographic and cultural variables remain less explored. Economics has traditionally dominated the scientific literature on domestic water consumption. From the economic perspective, water is generally considered to be an inelastic good since it can hardly be substituted, and users do not tend to perceive this resource as being too costly. Another factor is the improvement of the water supply network and the installation of saving devices. Others factors are the environmental awareness campaigns, use of the reused water for watering gardens and finally, the effect of the economic crisis and climatic conditions. In this sense, a currently example occurred in California where their inhabitants will have to reduce by 25% the consumption of water, under threat of heavy fines, to an extent unprecedented emergency with the drought in that state for four years. Perhaps the most important lesson to be learnt from the case of the Alicante coastline is the impact of the different urban residential typologies on water consumption generated by outdoor residential uses. The expansion of the residential and tourist population, incentivized for decades by different administrations, has brought about strong competition with other economic (agriculture) and environmental (wetland) functions for the use of land and water. In low-density developments, i.e., single homes with a single-family garden and swimming pool, the water consumption associated with outdoor areas is quite high, mainly due to the exclusive nature of their use by their owners. Urban typology consisting of condominiums and apartment blocks would therefore make for a more responsible and sustainable use of water resources associated with leisure. This is one finding that should be taken into account in the future planning of residential areas. In this sense, it is important to study and analyse the increase of urban sprawl on the coast of Alicante due to its impacts on water consumption. For this reason, in this dry region, urban typologies are a main element to account for when planning water resources in future scenarios.","Alicante; Coast; Consumption; Decrease; Water","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009353249"

This urban category has been recently revealed as an increasing line in the research field, as well as an opportunity to a more sustainable future of territorial strategies. This research aims to take a close approach over Mid-Sized Cities in the inner areas of Andalusia, as well as addressing a comprehensive and accurate definition of this case study, establishing the main features of this urban system and finishing with a brief diagnosis concerning the potentials and probable future sceneries from a sustainable perspective. Accordingly, it seeks to establish a wide, transversal analysis of the territorial and urban phenomenon which has conformed, for centuries, a set of small and mid-sized cities which represents, nowadays, the sixty percent of the land structure in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, still growing in terms of urban land and population. For this purpose, a particular study case has been selected: the cities in the centre of Andalusia (Spain). First of all, the study tries to set a summarised but full definition of the Mid-Sized Cities themselves, assuming them as a singular urban category, by setting the quantitative ranges and qualitative features more commonly accepted by both the academia and the official documents in the Iberian Peninsula, as well as in other latitudes and regions of the world. Down below, the main land planning instrument that defined this urban category in Andalusia in 2007 and has revealed the keys for their functioning and future opportunities is analysed, including a brief lists of the totality of cities that integrate the set and their populations. Further on, the characterization of the network has implied the study of the facts that led to the current dense collective of human settlements, as well as their evolution from the 20th century to the present time, as they have passed from being huge agricultural centres of production to become new industrial, touristic or services poles. In terms of demographic analysis, we have focused on urban, economic and demographic growth variables, considering the cities themselves and, particularly, in comparison with the evolution of the smaller cities they generally have being functionally connected to, with an added spotlight on their influence over the small rural settlements which, in turn, work as secondary points around the Mid-Sized Cities considered. The next step has implied the consideration of three processes that strongly conditioned the evolution and consolidation of the network of Mid-Sized Cities in the centre of Andalusia as they are today. Firstly, the substitution of the medium-distance railway network previously existent in the area by a renewed high-speed system with considerably fewer stations. Secondly, and contemporary with the previous one, the implementation of several highways that improved accessibility to a reduced number of privileged cities that experimented the higher rates of growth. Thirdly, the way all the infrastructural, economical, demographical and productive developments have derived into a deep transformation in the traditional identity and heritage resources of the cities considered. The study identifies Andalusian inner areas as a territory that has been intensively inhabited for centuries. As a result of this, a dense net of small cities remains as pillars of the urban system in an area that keeps being dominated by the agricultural productive system. Those cities are, furthermore, the key for population equilibrium, working as intermediate centres between rural areas and main cities. In terms of numbers, we can say that Mid-Sized Cities in Andalusia are between 10.000 and 50.000 inhabitants. The network has its very remote roots in proto-historic system of settlements, which established first and secondary centres in elevated places for the control of the territory. This double urban structure was replicated by Roman, Jewish and Muslim civilizations -often reducing the priority of some cities whereas others kept being considered territorial landmarks-, and strengthened by the feudal system during the Modern Age, when manor houses competed for land domain based in both rural properties and architectural monuments. Lately, the development of the agricultural system led to the establishment of a well-balance net of small cities whose main source of incomes was agriculture. Due to this fact, they were known as agro-cities or agro-towns from the XIXth to the first half of the XXth century. Nowadays, they have experienced a huge growing process in terms of economy, culture and urbanity and, although agriculture keeps being one of the main productive systems, their urban identity has turned to be about services and secondary administration centres and, more rarely, industrial. Recently they are also focusing on their heritage as an important pillar, especially regarding cultural tourism. However, nets of small towns have been revealed as great examples of urban and territorial sustainability. In fact, demographic statistics reveal that Mid-Sized Cities growth does not implicate rural depopulation but, on the contrary, strengthen inhabitants' bonds with the smallest settlements. The article has provided a range of outcomes, including the increasing presence of Andalusian Mid-Sized Cities into the international academia due to the significance and sustainability of their territorial and urban model; the definition of the urban category that is not based in their population but in their territorial and urban role; the evolution of their productive characterization along the last decades from agricultural to industrial and services; the sustainability of their demographic and urban growth; or the changes within their identity and heritage caused by their transformation.","Andalusia; Mid-Sized Cities; Rban networks; Territory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022005271"

Considered as a competitive alternative to the crisis of large enterprises that characterized the Fordist paradigm, they took advantage of the inherent benefits of the presence in the territory of a set of externalities or untraded Interdependencies that allowed them to successfully face the gradual intensification of international competltion.Thus, the literature refers to the district effect as the existence of a number of competitive advantages available to companies belonging to these territorial agglomerations compared to other companies that do not belong. Previous contributions confirm the existence of this effect In certain economic, financial and labor variables of district firms. However, there are fewer contributions that deal with the analysis of the district effect when variables are directly or Indirectly related to knowledge and enterprise Innovation.In this case, the different knowledge spillovers belonging to the district represent a prominent externality that leads to an interesting line of analysis focused on this issue. Based on this, our research aims to focus on this type of variables in order to extend the existing debate in the literature about the existence, extent and intensity of the district effect from the knowledge variables approach. In addition, as a control measure we have included various economic and financial variables to replicate traditional research and facilitate the contrasting of the results. For the empirical development of this research, we have built from various administrative information sources a database that includes a sample of 5,553 innovative companies located in the region of Valencia (Spain). This region accounts for the 10% of the Spanish GDP and 10.4% of its exports and 11% of total employment. The study period comprises from 2000 to 2006. The companies that were selected are those classified through various indicators as innovative companies since their innovative character is relevant for the development of the research due to their ability to better exploit knowledge spillovers. This is caused because they have greater internal resources that stimulate innovation processes. Firms are SMEs, usually family-owned and cover a wide range of industries such as textiles, footwear, toys, ceramics, food, furniture, electrical machinery, automotive industry, agriculture and tourism. Among other interesting data, the selected companies as a whole account for the 66% of investment in innovation of Valencian firms, compared to the 33% of large companies. On the other hand, the 39.3% of the firms of the whole sample are related to district configurations, while the remaining 60.7% are external. Once firms are identified, it has been considered whether or not they belong to an industrial district, based on the geographical demarcation of industrial districts proposed in relevant previous contributions in the research area. To analyze the sample it has been defined different types of knowledge variables, such as the generation of codified knowledge, firm relationships with agencies and institutions, human capital, innovation intensity and the type of innovation developed and its promotion. In addition, some control variables have been defined related to economic and financial issues. Building on the research approach, we start from the assumption that firms belonging to industrial districts benefit from the positive externalities located on the territory. A first global analysis based on growth indicators in different sectors shows that the construction sector and related companies, present better results than other industrial sectors, thus showing the impact on the industry that the growth of this sector has had. This result is relevant for the subsequent approach of the conclusions. Next, the analysis of the knowledge-related variables reported disparate results. On the one hand, non-district firms perform better in terms of staff costs and number of patents and utility models. By contrast, other variables such as investment in innovation, but not intensive in R&D, have better results in companies belonging to the district, while non-district firms invest more in contracts with local universities or R&D projects. In short, different behavior patterns are observed in the use of knowledge resources. District firms present a profile more linked to regional institutions, such as institutes of technology, and a less complex innovation, barely patented, and in some cases basing their protection on utility models. Meanwhile, non-district firms are more likely to interact with other knowledge sources as the university, develop greater R&D and patent protection. Additionally, economic and financial variables are analyzed in order to compare the results with major research on the district effect. Most variables showed significant differences in favor of firms belonging to an industrial district. However, in some variables that are of great interest such as financial performance or annual growth rate of sales, the values show differences in favor of the non-district firms. In terms of technological intensity, district firms produce products of medium or low technological levels, while non-district firms show a greater presence in the high-tech industry, mainly for the market of goods and services. This is partly logical since the major population areas of the Valencian region concentrate most of the regional knowledge resources. To conclude, it should be noted that some differences between both groups of firms are observed, but the results do not clearly confirm the existence of the district effect. In this regard, it is noteworthy that non-district firms have achieved better economic resultsin the period considered, making it difficult to sustain the presence of the district effect.On the other hand, the results may diverge from previous contributions. Some possible causes are: first, knowledge resources such as universities are mostly located in metropolitan areas that are not part of the industrial districts, except for example the case of ceramics in Castellón. Second, the industries located in districts are mainly low- and medium-tech manufactures, so they develop innovations with low R&D investment. Third, it is important to consider the period analyzed and the evolutionary behavior of firms. The entry of Spain into the Eurozone and the sharp reduction in mortgage interest rates were a stimulus for the development of the construction sector and a reorientation of part of the international businesses towards domestic markets related to real estate sector. In short, this suggests addressing the influence of external shocks to the district that can stimulate the diversion of industrial investment to sectors with higher expected returns in a short time space, as happened in the case studied. There remain for future contributions theresearch on the influence of exogenous and endogenous changes in the district effect and deepen the cognitive limits of the territory that the district covers, and, in particular, of the contextual knowledge that supports part of its strength.","District effect; Industrial districts; Innovative firms; Knowledge spillovers","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923332291"

In this paper the main land use change dynamics in Chiapas for the period 2007-2011 were identif ied at the regional level using maps, and were: deforestation of temperate secondary forest for subsistence agriculture plots (milpa) in the Highlands of Chiapas, deforestation of secondary vegetation of tropical evergreen rain-forest for cattle ranching La Selva and degradation of pine-oak forests in the Sierra Madre. Using regional land use change dynamic models associated with vegetation/land uses carbon stocks, impacts of land-use change dynamic, on edaphic carbon and opportunity costs were assessed. Moreover, using these same models public policy activities with positive impacts on edaphic carbon and socio-economic indicators were identif ied. Sustainable land use activities proposed were: conservation tillage and MIAF (maíz interspersed with fruit trees) for the Highlands of Chiapas, silvopastoral systems for La Selva region and secondary forest protection, forest management and commercial plantation of forest species for La Sierra. © 2016 Mexican Society of Soil Science.

To determine each threat and its pressure level on the ecosystem, we applied surveys and, based on social cartography methods, we obtained perception maps with relative threat magnitudes for each use, from very low to very high. The results suggest that the current economic model of San Andrés, almost totally dependent on massive tourism, may increase pressure intensities to the beach ecosystems due to increased pollution, urban development, land reclamation and exploitation of coastal resources. Tourists, the motor and beneficiaries of this socio-ecosystem, may be affected by these tensors, discouraging them to visit again the island. It is recommended to include in the island's management plans new legislations to minimize the impacts of beach use on this ecosystem.","Anthropogenic hazards; Ecosystem services; Marine protected areas; Risk perception; Sandy beaches","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027123910"

The anthropogenic Allee effect (AAE) is a conceptual model that seeks to explain how rarity may spread the seeds of further endangerment. The AAE model has increasingly been invoked in the context of trophy hunting, increasing concerns that such hunting may undermine rather than enhance conservation efforts. We question the appropriateness of uncritically applying the AAE model to trophy hunting for 4 reasons. First, the AAE assumes an open-access resource, which is a poor characterization of most trophy-hunting programs and obscures the potential for state, communal, or private-property use rights to generate positive incentives for conservation. Second, study results that show the price of hunting increases as the rarity of the animal increases are insufficient to indicate the presence of AAE. Third, AAE ignores the existence of biological and behavioral factors operating in most trophy-hunting contexts that tend to regulate the effect of hunting. We argue that site-specific data, rather than aggregated hunting statistics, are required to demonstrate that patterns of unsustainable exploitation can be well explained by an AAE model. Instead, we suggest that conservation managers seeking to investigate and identify constraints that limit the potential conservation role of trophy hunting, should focus on the critical governance characteristics that shape the potential conservation role of trophy hunting, such as corruption, insecure property rights, and inadequate sharing of benefits with local people. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","Conservation incentives; Economics; Governance; Open access; Trophy hunting","Animals; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Female; Human Activities; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Motivation; Reward; Animalia; acceso abierto; caza de trofeos; conservation incentives; economics; economía; gobernanza; governance; incentivos de conservación; open access; trophy hunting; Allee effect; anthropogenic effect; conservation management; corruption; environmental economics; governance approach; hunting; incentive; local planning; property rights; rarity; risk assessment; acceso abierto; animal; article; caza de trofeos; commercial phenomena; conservation incentives; economics; economía; environmental protection; female; gobernanza; governance; human; human activities; incentivos de conservación; male; motivation; open access; reward; theoretical model; trophy hunting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884731269"

Consequently, it was necessary to have tools to adequately quantify the sustainability of water resources management in arid regions. These indicators represent some of the tools used to quantitatively represent a series of attributes to characterize a system. They also make it possible to make comparisons to a reference scale, establish the state of a system with respect to the reference condition and identify its evolution and potential future state. The current environmental problem in the Lerma-Chapala River basin is the result of the interaction between political, economic and social factors in the region.

This strategy includes 17 goals (no poverty; zero hunger; good health and well being; quality education; gender equality; clean water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice and strong institutions; and partnerships for the goals), and 169 targets that are integrated together and are non divisible, and which cover environmental, social and economic aspects. To achieve these goals and targets it is necessary that governments and civil society participate together. México is one of the countries that signed the Agenda 2030. It is characterized by its big extension (1'973,000 km2) and population (123.5 millions), low economic growth of 2.3% in 2016 (El Economista, 2017), a high poverty level of 43.6% (Coneval, 2016), and a huge biodiversity (fifth place worldwide according to Llorente-Bousquets y Ocegueda, 2008). Because of this complex situation, it is particularly important to assess the contribution of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to Mexican sustainability. Thus, the objective of the this paper is to propose a general overview of the development of the Mexican NGOs, and to analyse the degree of coincidence of their activities with the UN Agenda 2030's framework for sustainable development. We use a framework close to constructivism and principally qualitative methods, including analysing and researching documentary information and statistic data, while maintaining an interdisciplinary perspective to study the three fundamental sustainability aspects (environmental, social and economic). The information sources included mainly NGOs web pages, the Ministry of Government (Segob), the Social Development Institute (Indesol), complemented with direct information provided by different stakeholders from the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) and NGOs', which provide different perspectives. We began by identifying the NGOs and their regional localization. Mexican national records have more than 30,000 NGOs (according to Indesol). The NGOs activity in México is regulated by the law called Ley Federal de Fomento a las Actividades Realizadas por Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil (LFFAROSC), approved in 2004. This law establishes 19 NGOs activities, and activity number 12 relates to sustainable development (SD) and includes: advice for the use of natural resources; environmental, flora and fauna protection; preservation and restoration of the ecological balance; as well as, sustainable development promotion at regional and community levels in urban and rural areas. We work with a subgroup of 5,636 NGOs related to SD, based on activity 12 of LFFAROSC. Later, we reduce the group to 21 NGOs recognized for their contribution at national level and which have accessible information. These 21 cases where selected by the characterization of a set of variables including their activities, their age and experience, their relationship with the government and the civil society, as well as, the origin of their resources. Then, the contribution from their activities to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals included in the Agenda 2030 is analysed. It was found that the Mexican NGOs had fast growth and that they have been focused on activity 12 of the LFFAROSC. Also the goals proposed in the Agenda 2030 related to the sustainable cities and communities, life on land, responsible consumption and production, quality education, and affordable and clean energy are covered by the NGOs. In contrast, some of the goals are not the main focus of the analysed NGOs, such as: no poverty, zero hunger, reduced inequalities and quality education (in addition to environmental awareness), among others. Nevertheless, these goals may be covered by NGOs that work in other LFFAROSC activities. Other goals that are not contemplated by the law, particularly those related to economic and political topics (decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; and peace, justice and strong institutions), where NGOs have less possibility to act. Hence, these responsibilities depended mostly on the government. In summary, the NGOs contribution to achieve the goals of the Agenda 2030 is relevant in the national context and fundamental in some country regions with less support for governmental programs. There are some limitations to this study: 1) the 21 NGOs selected for the analysis are not representative of the complete NGOs universe related to SD; 2) the variables used for the analysis where helpful according to the objective of this paper, specialty the description of the NGOs activities, the experience, their relationship with government and civil society, as well as the origin of the resources. Nevertheless, it will be helpful to have data about financial and human resources availability (volunteers and remunerated); and 3) with regards to the production of knowledge of the NGOs, we only did a general description of the variety of documents that they use for the diffusion of knowledge, but a deeper content analysis is necessary to think about quality and utility. The work presented constitutes a first approach to the contribution of the main NGOs activities to SD in México. Further research could look at an impact evaluation that identify, quantify, explain and assess the influence to the country in the light of the goals of the UN Agenda 2030.","Assessment; México; Non-Governmental Organizations; Sustainable Development Goals","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040658427"

WSD policy goals, by improving the natural resource base, aim to improve the livelihoods of rural communities through increased sustainable production. It has generally been practiced at a micro-level of less than 500 ha, as this was seen to be a scale that would encourage participative management. There has been some concern that this land area may be too small and may lead to less than optimal hydrological, economic and equity outcomes. As a result there has been a move to create guidelines for meso-scale WSD of above 5,000 ha in an endeavour to improve outcomes. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to evaluate the proposed meso-scale approach. In developing an adequate methodology for the evaluation it soon became clear that scale in itself was not the only determinant of success. The effect of geographical scale (or level) on WSD is determined by the variation in other drivers that will influence WSD success such as hydrological conditions, land use and available institutional structures. How this should be interpreted at different levels in the light of interactions between biophysical and socio-economic scales is discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Groundwater/surface-water relations; India; Scale; Socio-economic aspects; Watershed","India; development project; groundwater; guideline; surface water; sustainable development; water management; watershed","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865377161"

Connell (2004) argues that major changes in the level of research take two directions: increasing opportunities for partnerships and cross-border partnerships and greater incentives for innovation (Connell, 2004). One of the most visible elements of this process of change can clearly be seen when the new competitive responsibilities assumed by scientific research institutions to raise funds for Research and Development (I + D) are analyzed. These changes meant a strong redefinition of the relevance of scientific knowledge for the purposes of economic development. Science, technology and innovation have become elements whose effects contribute to changing the lives of citizens. From this perspective is value model science as socio-cultural practice as an activity of translation or interpretation of nature and society that tries to show how the space of production and circulation of scientific knowledge is created (Sanz Menendez and Santesmases, 1996). Science and technology appear as a ""cultural product characterized by its dynamism, its multiplier effect and its social nature"" (Sabato, 1994). In this context, public policies seek to organize effectively the research and development capabilities with a view to greater overlap between institutions and territory. The change is based on the ""translation of research into products and new ventures"" (Etzkowitz, Webster and Healey, 1998:1 in Rovelli, 2015). The so-called model of the ""Triple Helix"", developed by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1997), for example recasts the role of research within the university-industry-government triad postulated crosslinking and to the dilution of the boundaries between them and predicts growth of a spiral model of innovation that interrelates practical and theoretical issues in the interstices of rigid demarcations of the past (Rovelli, 2015). From this model, the national state is not the only actor in the definition of public policies on science and technology. International credit agencies, the supra-state or regional institutions, instances of local political power and the market in its various configurations, are major actors in the process of designing and implementing policy change science, technology and innovation. Argentina has not been exempt from these trends. Research policy and research policies focused on increased social use of science and technology from the institution of structures and coordination of resources and capabilities between them. In particular, he appealed to the definition of structuring systems of land management, as delegated public service, which organizes land use from the distribution of research capabilities and development consistent with a regional approach. The purpose of the article is to explain and characterize the initiatives of territorial and regional planning at the national scientific system between the years 1996-2007. In particular, it explores: What are the objectives regionalization policies? What is the socio-political context of the initiatives? and how the institutional framework is structured in the regionalization process? documentary sources and semi-structured interviews with key informants from the academic and political fields were analyzed. The findings show that between 1996 and 2007 regional planning structures and territorial development within the framework of a national policy of federalization, with a distribution of resources and transfer of legal-institutional powers are created. However, its configuration as decentralized management with affective capacities is strongly linked to the structures and cultures of organizations each of the agencies under analysis. The analysis of the data revealed that the policies of regionalization and territorial planning are set from the distribution of institutional legal to exercise the promotion, coordination and management of science policy at the regional level powers. These objectives conceive science and technology from a change of linear model but are configured according to the characteristics of the organizational structures of each region. That is, the change is developed as isomorphism. In these notes the analysis of the initiatives of territorial and regional development in the science and technology system organized into sixth sections. After a brief review of a socio-political perspective for policy analysis (first section), the methodological aspects (second section), and a summary of relevant background in the federal distribution of institutional legal for science powers arise, technology and innovation (third section); it is argued that there is possible to detect a tradition of national science policy planning in the sixties when are constituted - and distribute-regional structures with approaches taken by the federal and community contributors. This planning comes in active interaction with a backdrop of discussions and confrontation of approaches around the issue of economic development in non-industrialized or industrializing countries. However, certain disruptive factors such as the absence of specific regulations, have hampered the ability to explain and give consistency to the policy objectives of Science and Technology. This tradition of planning is recovered in the Nineties under a paradigm of strategic planning that sought an order in the system of science and technology from a clear distinction between new organisms public planning at the federal level, on the one hand and institutions that develop activities science and technology on the other. In light of this background, the fourth and fifth section examines the policies of science, technology and innovation between 2001 and 2007. The findings allow review tradition -not without tensions and territorial approach spark-contexts-thus distinguishing the historical character of their interventions. From a legal and political-institutional level the progress of a scenario of increasing institutionalization and functional differentiation of structures arises. However, the organizational perspective on these new structures or institutions put in tension the purpose of state planning systemically.

The model is then applied in a numerical analysis of groundwater contamination by chloride from highway deicers, demonstrating the relevance of the theoretical results to practical management settings. This analytical approach can help determine which policy instruments are likely to be effective in controlling groundwater pollution, especially if costly numerical groundwater models are not available for the aquifer in question. Unlike previous economic studies of groundwater contamination, this approach defines optimal emissions policies as a function of geophysical parameters employed by hydrologists such as distance between source and sink, groundwater velocity, and aquifer dispersivity. The theoretical section of this paper also demonstrates that the relationship between geophysical parameters and optimal emissions levels may be ambiguous. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Analytical solutions; Groundwater protection; Socio-economic aspects; USA","United States; analytical framework; aquifer; groundwater resource; hydrological modeling; mathematical analysis; socioeconomic impact; theoretical study; water management; water quality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865434059"

Red-legged partridge is a greatly valued game species, whose conservation status has been, and probably still is, poor. In small-game hunting estates, great efforts are devoted to red-legged partridge management, but many practices are applied without knowing their real consequences for partridge populations. Reviewed studies show that the most successful management options to increase the abundance of the species, allowing a sustainable harvest, would include an adequate adjustment of annual harvest to partridge abundance, appropriate habitat management promoting the presence of natural vegetation within the farmland matrix and field edges, and water and food supplementation. Information about the efficacy of predator control to increase red-legged partridge abundance is inconclusive. Releases of farm-reared partridges are putting at risk the genetic integrity of the species. Furthermore, when few partridges are released, releases do not increase annual harvest or estate profitability, and negatively affect the productivity of wild red-legged partridges. Despite leisure and economic movement generated by red-legged partridge hunting, inadequate management is currently reducing the potential benefits of this activity. © 2012 Los Autores.

Over the last few decades, new information has revealed the essential connection between the economical development of a territory, centred on its acts and the local surrounding areas. (Váquez-Barquero, 1999:27). These territories have increased their roles in playing a vital part in global and local development (Storper, 1997:3). To understand these new ideas, it is necessary to look at the process of globalization, which helps towards the growth of understanding global capitalism (Hudson and William, 1999; Knox and Agnew, 2002). In this way, the tourist industry as a whole, can gain importance as a fundamental instrument in global change, from a regional and local point of view. We have to value the importance of tourism which can act as a vital tool in the potential of economical development. (Milne and Altejevic, 2001; Merinero et al., 2014). During the last few decades, studies have been made to analyse populated areas. These areas are no longer seen as mere geographical regions. Social science sectors have begun to study the elements linked to these areas of interest or stakeholders, local economy and the possible alternatives of economical change (population, visitors, workers, governments, entrepreneurs, culture, and local resources). Consequently, discussions have begun to talk about the economical development in such territories (Amin, 1989; Sayer, 1995). Currently, and with respect to everything that has occurred in other European regions, Andalusia is in a process of a structural change where the local entities are acquiring a growing recognition based on the enhancement of the value of their resources in developing tourism. (Pulido-Fernández and Sánchez-Rivero, 2010), with the belief that these activities have a strong and positive affect on the whole economy. In this context, as a hypothesis of this investigation, it's established that the level of dynamic touristic economy is infuenced by the level of socio-economic development (SD). In other words, the most dynamic territories from a touristic point of view are the ones that experiment with a higher degree of social-economic development, which shows that tourism is an important tool for its development. To verify this hypothesis, two indictors have been created to measure the level of touristic economy and SD on this subject matter. Andalusian communities verify whether there is any connection between both indicators and by creating a classification of these municipalities it allows us to obtain some solid conclusions. The results obtained in this investigation have allowed the verification of the hypothesis. It is clear that the most dynamic territories from a touristic point of view are the ones that have experimented a higher level of SD. Consequently, tourism can be an essential instrument in its development, as long as they are able to fulfil the necessary conditions for the touristic activities and therefore the creation of wealth, with the objective to promote and maintain the prosperity or economical and social wellbeing of the population of these territories. On the other hand, two indexes have been developed (EDT index and SD index) which have helped to classify the analyzed municipalities and obtain conclusions of the analyzed variables. In particular when considering the EDT index, we can firstly confirm that the coast-line destinations have shown a higher EDT during the analyzed period. In fact, eleven out of the twenty-five municipalities have determined the ranking are these types of destinies. In addition, the first ten correspond to the touristic dynamics linked to the sun and the beach, except for ""Arcos de la Frontera"". We are now able to conclude that the main argument to explain the dynamism of the Andalusian touristic destinies is due to the costal influence and, consequently, sun and beach tourism. It's also possible to find other arguments that explain these touristic dynamics. For example, cities like Arcos de la Frontera and Antequera are part of a different type of destination of which offer a patrimonial resource and cultural attractions, as well as being orientated in the direction of an urban-cultural tourism market. Also, municipalities like Mairena del Aljarafe or Dos Hermanas are included in this ranking, whose touristic dynamism is due to it is proximity to Seville, a city with a large touristic attraction that has influences in a positive way all the surrounding areas of this town. In fourth place, one can highlight a group of rural municipalities, like Serón, Láujar de Andarax, Fuenteheridos, Tabernas or Castellar de la Frontera, which are known to add potential natural resources and cultural-gastronomic wealth benefiting the rural development, creating a rural touristic attraction. If we take into account the SD index, we can also conclude that the municipalities of the Andalusian coasts, especially all the coast of Málaga, are mainly the ones to feature the higher SD during the analyzed period. Together with these municipalities there are some others that make up the metropolitan areas of Seville (Tomares, Mairena del Aljarfe), Granada (La Zubia) and Almería (Huércal de Almería). Nevertheless, some important municipalities have appeared at the Top25 of the SD index ranking that don't form part of the Top25 of the EDT index ranking, providing further evidence that shows that there are municipalities with a SD that isn't necessarily to do with a higher EDT but of other considerations, which have had a greater influence in the SD than in their own touristic activities. It has been proven that even in the well-established touristic destinations the main source behind the SD isn't tourism, although it is responsible for the economical activities that boost it. The fair climate, along with good easy-access infrastructures, the life-style, high socializing and understanding of social relations abilities, etc. have turned these territories into a popular area for secondary homes (inclusive first homes for foreigners) and, consequently, favourable for property development. These are behaviour situations that are important to avoid if we want to ensure the success of these territories as high quality touristic destinations. In these cases, the roles of the government are crucial to guarantee sound territorial planning and an efficient use of resources. Also, to break up the dangerous instumentalization of tourism to justify the dynamics of property development that keeps being valued as a significant role in promoting the touristic cycles which is in every way a false one and its done out of personal interest but it doesn't favour tourism, on the contrary, it has reverse effect upon the territory and population. On the other hand, tourism can contribute to the SD of a territory in a way that is has multiplying effects on the rest of economical sectors and on productional activities, as long as the connection between these different sector activities are ensured. Once again, this fact raises the need to guarantee a suitable preparation of the touristic activities and a co participation and shared management, where all the implied factors of the touristic development of whichever territory are involved. In spite of the fact that the results obtained have allowed to verify this hypothesis, it should be acknowledged, however that there is an important limitation when carrying out this investigation. As explained in the methodological section, the availabity of disaggregated information at municipalities level is very limited, which is why it has been difficult to arrange some indicators to measure the two analyzed variables (EDT and SD). Henceforth, one of the future work proposals taken out during this analysis is the construction of a system of indicators which allow us to measure both variables with absolute reliability. Another restriction that is important to take into account is the current economic crisis which has affected the results obtained, this makes it necessary to repeat the same analysis with the upto-date data once the statistic resources allow this update. Finally, although one has been able to demonstrate that there is a direct and positive relation between EDT and SD, the most interesting thing is the identification of the aspects that favour or constrain this connection. Henceforth, the next step in a future investigation would be to identify these factors and ultimately explain why the occupied areas in the formulated rankings by the municipalities aren't the same, and in addition an advanced and detailed study of each case.","Andalusia (Spain); Economic dynamism of tourism; Socioeconomic development; Structural equation modeling; Tourism destination","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014030897"

The research links, for the first time, the surface in hands of these big landlords -8.3 millions of hectares in total- with its respective soil use and production. The reviewed evidence gave rise to some relevant conclusion s regarding the current production and social structure. On the one hand, the traditional landlord class comes up as the core of the agrarian sector in the pampas today, not only due to the size of their lands but also because of their particularly high yields per hectare. Though livestock activities predominate considering the use of soil, the opposite happens in terms of production value. This implies that the spread vision of the mainly livestock character of the landlord production in the Province of Buenos Aires, and hence their low productivity, can be considered as a past characteristic in the best case. On the other hand, the strong pre sence of big landlords in the Buenos Aires agricultural production points to an alternative conclusion vis-à-vis the predominating one. It is not the medium-large size landlords -a sort of local ""farmers""-but the big traditional landlords who have driven technological and productive transformations in the pampas rural sector during the last decades. In particular, this process is lead by the oligarch landlord class who controls its lands though society groups and obtains significantly higher yields thanks to both owing the best lands and working them more intensively.","","Argentina; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; economic reform; landowner; productivity; rural economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-23944506095"

With this premise, knowing the issues that determinate the forest behaviour is the basis to understand this forest success and, therefore, to simulate the future subsector evolution that allows to plan public measures of supporting. This paper is part of a broader study, which develops a new methodology for surveying and characterising private forest owners in Galicia. Here, we present results from a questionnaire survey carried out with a total of 103 landowners who had over 1 ha of productive forest land in the Barreiros municipality, located in Northern of Lugo province, with the aim of characterizing the individual property and understanding the owners' decision-making in forestry. The analysis shows that forestry can be an interesting economic activity, although it is not seen as such today. Take into account the partial success of measures exclusively forest or agrarian, to ensure the future of Galician property will necessitate public tools or programmes orientated to integrate the set of agroforestry activities on family farm. Therefore, it will motivate the generational continuity of the farm by means of agroforestry practices.","Forest economy; Individual forest owner; Land uses; Small-scale forestry","Eurasia; Europe; Galicia; Lugo [Galicia]; Southern Europe; Spain; agroforestry; decision making; economic activity; forest management; forestry practice; forestry production; land use; landowner","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247530795"

This paper focuses on analyzing them, following a developmental concern regarding the role that the agriculture sector can play. In the paper it is argued that two kinds of production organization models are currently coexisting in the agriculture sector in Argentina. One of them, in steady decline, is the traditional one characterized by a strong vertical integration of the economic activities and in which the farmer is central in the decision making process. The other one, increasing its participation, is network-based in which contracts play a key role in sustaining network relations. The network configuration of the emergent model enaoles both a greater risk diversification and a less centralized, and more interdependent, decision making process than the traditional one. In addition, the 'new'model, which currently represents two thirds of the total agriculture production, is further characterized by the separation between the agents that owned the land (the land owners) and the ones that perform the economic activity itself (the production firms). At the same time, a significant portion of the activities are subcontracted. Therefore, in the new model subcontractors and suppliers have a strong presence and visibility as nodes of the production network. The new way the 'controlled biologic production' is organized entails that: i) the boundaries between primary activities, Industry and services tend to diffuse, ii) the amount of economic agents involved in production increases, iii) power in the rent-generating and rent-capturing processes is re-balanced, iv) risks are redistributed and v) the links between this activity and the rest of the economy get stronger. In addition, this new model leads to a redefinition of the orientation and implementation of the externally oriented strategies that aim to capture higher international rents to use in the local developmental process.","","Argentina; South America; agricultural economics; agricultural market; agricultural production; decision making; economic activity; economic development; participatory approach; policy implementation; risk assessment; vertical integration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67949122067"

The Anchorenas (who would soon became the largest landholders of the Argentine Confederation) are usually described as a paradigmatic example of this shift. The evidence produced here suggests that this interpretation requires revision. A close examination at the Anchorena brothers' papers, and to judicial sources, indicates that, rather than concentrating on rural production, these large capitalists diversified his assets into several spheres of activity -commerce, finance, urban rents and rural production-. I argue that this pattern of investment emerged as a result of businessmen's attempts to cope with economic and political instability, which was a recurrent feature of River Plate history in the first half century after independence.","","Argentina; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; Argentina (fish); Bos taurus; cattle; commercial activity; nineteenth century; ranching","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-19444366234"

Convergence appears with similar intensity with respect to the three benchmarks, and in the years previous to the structural break which, in general, was situated endogenously at the end of the 1980s or at the beginning of the 1990s. Moreover, tax convergence is basically centred on income and profits, and goods and services taxation. The empirical evidence shows that the autonomy of the countries, their different economic structures and political preferences regarding the degree of public intervention, prevail over the idea of fiscal equalization in the EU.","Convergence; European union; Tax policy; Time series analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650506539"

However, metals contamination associated with mining can be highly toxic to aquatic life, the composition of metalbearing rock often leads to acid mine drainage and increased concentrations of dissolved metals, and mine-related disruptions to soil and water often produce excess fine sediments and altered stream flows. Such environmental degradation leads to large numbers of perpetually polluted streams and impaired aquatic life and fisheries. The primary U.S. law governing mining, the General Mining Law of 1872, was passed during the pick-and-shovel era to encourage economic growth; however, modern mining processes are massive in extent, highly mechanized, and incorporate additional toxic chemicals for leaching metals from ores. We provide an overview of hardrock mining impacts to aquatic life, a set of mining case studies, and suggestions for amending U.S. mining law. Our hope is that this article will lead to improved management and rehabilitation of existing mine sites and sufficient protections for the aquatic life and fisheries likely to be disturbed by future mines.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954388112"

We consider three aspects of this question: the interpolation technique used, the inclusion of air quality as a continuous vs discrete variable in the model, and the estimation method. Using a sample of 115,732 individual house sales for 1999 in the South Coast Air Quality Management District of Southern California, we compare Thiessen polygons, inverse distance weighting, Kriging and splines to carry out spatial interpolation of point measures of ozone obtained at 27 air quality monitoring stations to the locations of the houses. We take a spatial econometric perspective and employ both maximum-likelihood and general method of moments techniques in the estimation of the hedonic. A high degree of residual spatial autocorrelation warrants the inclusion of a spatially lagged dependent variable in the regression model. We find significant differences across interpolators in the coefficients of ozone, as well as in the estimates of willingness to pay. Overall, the Kriging technique provides the best results in terms of estimates (signs), model fit and interpretation. There is some indication that the use of a categorical measure for ozone is superior to a continuous one. © 2006 Regional Studies Association.","Air quality valuation; Hedonics; Real estate; Spatial econometrics; Spatial interpolation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877733055"

The evaluation of the causal effects of property rights, however, is a difficult task as their allocation is typically endogenous. To overcome this identification problem, we exploit a natural experiment in the allocation of land titles. In 1981, squatters occupied a piece of land in a poor suburban area of Buenos Aires. In 1984, a law was passed expropriating the former owners'land to entitle the occupants. Some original owners accepted the government compensation, while others disputed the compensation payment in the slow Argentine courts. These different decisions by the former owners generated an exogenous allocation of property rights across squatters. Using data from two surveys performed in 2003 and 2007, we find that entitled families substantially increased housing investment, reduced household size, and enhanced the education of their children relative to the control group. These effects, however, did not take place through improvements in access to credit. Our results suggest that land titling can be an important tool for poverty reduction, albeit not through the shortcut of credit access, but through the slow channel of increased physical and human capital investment, which should help to reduce poverty in future generations.","","Argentina; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; compensation system; human capital; land market; landownership; poverty alleviation; property rights; resource allocation; suburban area; urban housing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80051893669"

Most of this land was held by the Catholic Church, which derived considerable economic and political power from its ownership. The Radical faction of the Liberal Party, which governed the country between 1863 and 1876, promoted numerous reforms directed at eliminating the institutions that had survived the years of Spanish colonial rule, and were an obstacle to the advance of the economy. A substantial portion of all the properties of the Church were thus expropriated. This process was culminated with the signing of a treaty -""Concordato""- between the Colombian government and Holy See. The treaty recognized in favor of the Church ""the value of disentailed loans and property"". Colombian historiography has given little attention to the process of disentailment, as a result of the influence of the Conservative historiography, which portrayed it as a failure. This mistaken appreciation can only be corrected through research in primary sources. In this paper we have used primary sources that had not been discussed in the most influential works on Colombian economic history of the 19th century and conclude that it was the main economic reform of that period, since it represented at least 16% of the GDP of 1860 and was a very profitable operation for the government.","Disentailment; Economic historiography","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70449644485"

Paying little attention to the disaggregated behavior of the variables on which the sustainability of production systems relies, or an inappropriate consideration of the time scales needed for their measurement, could lead to erroneous valuations of land sustainability.

Unfortunately, this area has been reduced by fire, pests, changes in land use, extensive grazing and indiscriminate clandestine lumbering. This tendency is a threat for the zone because constant population growth and urban activity are generating a severe imbalance between these and the natural resources. In this context, the present study was conducted to investigate whether the population of eastern State of Mexico recognizes the economic value of the environmental services of the forest resource, and to estimate the economic value of these services. The methodology used was the contingent valuation method, which uses information gathered directly from the population to obtain the economic valuation of these services. The results show that the population recognizes the economic value of the environmental services of the forest; preferences were obtained for each of these, where combating air pollution was the most important, followed by conservation of flora, fauna, and soil.

Examples show the credit value calculations for determining baseline conditions and for assessing impacts to species habitat. Additional examples illustrate the incentives for creating habitats that support abundant, stable populations and the incentives for reducing the severity and duration of impacts to habitats.

In this paper, we created an index to quantify the contribution of each newly created national park to the conservation of the biogeographic diversity of Argentina ecoregions. To analyze how the creation of national parks changed in relation to macroeconomic shifts, we performed superposed epoch analyses for the period 1930-2004 and for the two included subperiods with the same temporal extent, using independently two macroeconomic indicators (Gross Domestic Product and Relative Public Administration Incomes) as the independent variables, and the creation of a national park as the dependent one; and we correlated Gross Domestic Product per capita and Relative Public Administration Incomes with the extent and originality of parks. Finally, we compared extent and originality of national parks between different government periods and between groups of democratic and non-democratic periods of government. Superposed epoch analyses showed that years of creation of national parks tended to lag one year of high Gross Domestic Product growth, particularly during the last four decades, when correlation between macroeconomic variables and creation of national parks were possitive. The ""Década Infame"" period (1930-1945) was responsible of the major addition of national parks area, and the ""Neoliberal"" period (1990-2001) showed the highest originality and number of parks created. Non-democratic governments generated the largest area of national parks and democratic governments, the highest biogeographical originality. Based on these results, the history of Argentine national parks creation can be classified into two major stages characterized by different spatial patterns and causal mechanisms. During the National Defense Stage (from 1930 to the mid 1960s) large national parks where created mostly on international boundaries and, due to the priority assigned to territorial sovereignty, their creation were relatively independent of economic variables. During the Biogeographic Diversification Stage (from the mid 1960s to 2004) many smaller parks where created on diverse ecoregions with growing land price.

Research has focused more on social cooperation and conflict of different management regimes and less on how these factors actually affect the natural environments they seek to conserve. Consequently, it is still unknown which strategies yield better conservation outcomes? We conducted a meta-analysis of 116 published case studies on common resource management regimes from Africa, south and central America, and southern and Southeast Asia. Using ranked sociodemographic, political, and ecological data, we analyzed the effect of land tenure, population size, social heterogeneity, as well as internally devised resource-management rules and regulations (institutions) on conservation outcome. Although land tenure, population size, and social heterogeneity did not significantly affect conservation outcome, institutions were positively associated with better conservation outcomes. There was also a significant interaction effect between population size and institutions, which implies complex relationships between population size and conservation outcome. Our results suggest that communities managing a common resource can play a significant role in conservation and that institutions lead to management regimes with lower environmental impacts. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Common-pool resource management; Conservation; Development; Land tenure; Meta-analysis; Population size; Social heterogeneity","Africa; Asia, Southeastern; Central America; Community-Institutional Relations; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cooperative Behavior; Decision Making; Economic Development; Environment; Ownership; Population Density; Socioeconomic Factors; South America; Africa; Central America; South America; South Asia; Southeast Asia; community resource management; conservation management; conservation status; environmental impact; heterogeneity; land tenure; meta-analysis; political participation; population size; resource management; strategic approach; sustainable development; Africa; article; Central America; cooperation; decision making; economic development; economics; environment; environmental protection; meta analysis; methodology; organization and management; population density; public relations; socioeconomics; South America; Southeast Asia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954170162"

An understanding of why landowners convert grassland to cropland could facilitate more effective design of grassland-conservation programs. We built an empirical model of land-use change in the Prairie Pothole Region (north-central United States) to estimate the probability of grassland conversion to alternative agricultural land uses, including cultivated crops. Conversion was largely driven by landscape characteristics and the economic returns of alternative uses. Our estimate of the probability of grassland conversion to cultivated crops (1.33% on average from 1979 to 1997) was higher than past estimates (0.4%). Our model also predicted that grassland-conversion probabilities will increase if agricultural commodity prices continue to follow the trends observed from 2001 to 2006 (0.93% probability of grassland conversion to cultivated crops in 2006 to 1.5% in 2011). Thus, nearly 121 million ha (30 million acres) of grassland could be converted by 2011. Conversion probabilities, however, are spatially heterogeneous (range 0.2% to 3%), depending on characteristics of a parcel (e.g., soil quality and economic returns). Grassland parcels with relatively high-quality land for agricultural production are more likely to be converted to cultivated crops than lower-quality parcels and are more responsive to changes in the economic returns on alternative agricultural land uses (i.e., conversion probability increases by a larger magnitude for high-quality parcels when economics returns to alternative uses increase). Our results suggest that grassland conservation programs could be proactively targeted toward high-risk parcels by anticipating changes in economic returns, such as could occur if a new biofuel processing plant were to be built in an area. ©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Agricultural intensification; Conservation planning; Conversion probability; Land-use change; Transition matrix","Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment; Likelihood Functions; Midwestern United States; Models, Theoretical; Montana; Probability; Soil; Triticum; Zea mays; Prairie Pothole Region; agricultural land; agricultural production; biofuel; conservation planning; cultivation; grassland; intensive agriculture; land use change; probability; agriculture; conference paper; economics; ecosystem; environment; environmental protection; maize; probability; soil; statistical model; theoretical model; United States; wheat","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952730542"

In rural and semirural areas, local and regional government agencies are commonly responsible for encouraging landholders to conserve native vegetation and species on these private properties. Yet these agencies often lack the capacity to design and implement conservation programs tailored to rural and semirural landholdings and instead offer one program to all landholders. Landholders may elect not to participate because the program is irrelevant to their property or personal needs; consequently, vegetation-retention objectives may not be achieved. We differentiated landholders in Queensland, Australia, according to whether they derived income from the land (production landholders) or not (nonproduction landholders). We compared these two groups to identify similarities and differences that may inform the use of policy instruments (e.g., voluntary, economic, and regulatory) in conservation program design. We interviewed 45 landholders participating in three different conservation agreement programs (price-based rate [property tax] rebate; market-based tender; and voluntary, permanent covenant). Production landholders were more likely to participate in short-term programs that offered large financial incentives that applied to <25% of their property. Nonproduction landholders were more likely to participate in long-term programs that were voluntary or offered small financial incentives that applied to >75% of their property. These results may be explained by significant differences in the personal circumstances of production and nonproduction landholders (income, education, health) and differences in their norms (beliefs about how an individual is expected to act) and attitudes. Knowledge of these differences may allow for development of conservation programs that better meet the needs of landholders and thus increase participation in conservation programs and retention of native vegetation. ©2011 Society for Conservation Biology.","Community-based conservation; Conservation policy; Landholder attitudes; Tropics","Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Geography; Motivation; Queensland; Social Environment; Australia; Queensland; financial system; incentive; landholding; long-term change; policy analysis; rural area; article; Australia; ecosystem; environmental protection; geography; methodology; motivation; social environment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955845651"

In doing so, it will be possible to check out when a particular inequality measure performs in a suitable way.

With the aim to evaluate the ecological state of two mountains streams in sections that cross communes of tourist interest, indexes of water and riparian forest quality were combined. In each stream, two stations were selected, one downstream and the other upstream of the recreation areas. Environmental data were registered and benthos samples were collected in the main geomorphological units, during high and low water periods. Metric indexes and Índice Biótico Carcarañá (IBC) based on benthic macroinvertebrates were calculated, and the marginal forest quality was determined by the Riparian Quality Index (QBR). The results were integrated by a modification of index ECOSTRIMED to evaluate the ecological status of the fluvial system. In both streams, the physico-chemical variables showed normal values and the metric indexes determined that the water quality vary between ""moderately deteriorated"" and ""little deteriorated"", whereas the IBC revealed a ""unpolluted environment"" in all sampling situations. Application of QBR showed that the riparial forest with important alterations and extreme degradation were located close to urban areas, while in the other reaches the alteration degree was translated in judgments of acceptable and good quality. When combining the results of the metric indexes with those of the QBR, in both streams were obtained quality judgments that indicated ""good"" and ""intermediate"" ecological status in the stretches located upstream of urban areas and ""intermediate"" in the stretches downstream of recreation areas. The results of this study contribute to corroborate that, from a biological perspective; the application of a set of metric is the most efficient and economic methodology, to evaluate the quality of the water since they integrate information derived from diverse aspects of the benthonic community. Although in the studied streams the water didn't have very good biological quality, in urban reaches, the degradation or elimination of the marginal vegetation was the main determinant of the altered ecological quality.","Benthic macroinvertebrates; Biotic indices; Metric indices; QBR; Water quality","Argentina; Cordoba [Argentina]; anthropogenic effect; benthos; biotic factor; data set; ecological impact; ecotourism; environmental assessment; fluvial process; geomorphology; habitat fragmentation; macrobenthos; macroinvertebrate; mountain stream; physicochemical property; riparian forest; tourist destination; urban area; water quality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79961230271"

The aspects analyzed were productive reconversion, the solution of conflicts and organization within the agrarian centers, and problems of conservation of natural resources and practices for their solution. The calculation of frequencies was used for the data analysis. It was found that the legal security in land possession was insufficient for producing a change in the crop pattern, but it did contribute to an easier access to governmental programs such as PROCAMPO, and to the solution of conflicts. However, it also propitiated other problems, such as the disintegration of the agrarian centers, which implicitly leads to an increase in the disorganization of the producers.

The effect on profitability of a eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) plantation in the Central Valley of the Bío Bío Region, Chile, of three irrigation systems was studied: microsprinklers (T1), drip irrigation (T2) and surface irrigation (T3). The variable projected to harvest age was the volumetric increase of the trees. To calculate costs of T1 and T2, a database was used of 200 agricultural operations of varying size where these systems were installed and implemented. For T3, current costs of construction and maintenance of the structures required were used for financial evaluation. Profitability was determined using net present value (NPV), potential land value (PLV) and modified internal return rate (MIRR). Profitability with T1 and T2 had negative values; that is, these irrigation techniques did not generate economic benefits. Surface irrigation (T3) was profitable for the volume projected to eight and ten years harvest age. The greatest returns were obtained with the three indicators using a discount rate of 8 % and a price of pulp wood of US$ 32 m-3 ssc. NPV was US$ 989 ha-1 and US$ 1106 ha-1; PLV was US$ 2152 and 2406 ha-1, and MIRR was 10.4 % and 10.1 %.

The caloric sufficiency index is different among conglomerates of DG and increases in the measure that the proportion of agricultural income in total income increases. The wage work strategy (37.6%) and the agriculture-wage labor strategy (42.6%) do not cover energy requirements of the DG. The agricultural strategy is the only one that satisfies calorie intake needs of the DG (19.8%).

Forest harvesting in South Patagonia has been an activity based on colonization and exploitation of new areas. Harvesting is mainly carried out in old-growth forests without silviculture management after the first cuts. Beyond this mismanagement, scientific research defined the basis to conserve, protect and improve the present forest management for the South Patagonia native forests. The first long-term study permanent plots (1965-1966) monitored only economic and forest structure parameters, and near twenty plots were established in public forested lands of Tierra del Fuego. Most of these plots were destroyed or discontinued due to a lack of land use planning, scarce social interest for long- term researches, absence of commitment of institutions, and few contributions of forest companies. After this, a second group of nine long-term study permanent plots were established in South Patagonia (1993-2004) based in the collaboration between private companies and national research institutions. The objectives included economic as well as ecological parameters. The new plots were established on private lands based on several agreements and joint venture projects between national institutions, private companies and ranch owners. The main limitations in these processes were: a lack of commitment from the provincial forest administrations, absence of long-term financed projects and a clear forest policy from the government, and that continuity of plot measurements rely only under the responsibility of researchers. The study of the long-term plots allowed: (i) to propose new harvesting systems by maximizing yield and improving conservation value of managed forests (e.g., variable retention and silvopastoral systems), (ii) to determine the economical feasibility of the intermediate treatments, (iii) to define base-lines and impacts of different silvicultural treatments, (iv) to propose a wide spectrum of monitoring methodologies and establish demonstrative areas of forest management, and (v) to provide areas and knowledge to train professionals in forest management and biodiversity conservation practices. The surviving permanent plots in Nothofagus forest in South Patagonia and the obtained information could be used as a starting point to define a regional nucleus that could participate in the International Long Term Ecological Research to improve the use of native forests. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.","Biodiversity; Monitoring; Nothofagus forests; Private companies; Silviculture.","Bos; Nothofagus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955627349"

Because of its fragmented distribution at mid- and high elevations of the humid mountain ranges (mostly but not continuously between 1500 and 2500 m altitude), its complex biogeographic history, and its adjacency with many other vegetation types, Mexican cloud forests host at least 10% of the country's vascular plant flora, estimated at around 27 000 species. A recent appraisal showed that of a total of 762 tree species that thrive in these forests, at least 60% are in one of the various threat categories defined by the IUCN (23% Vulnerable, 27% Endangered, and 11% Critically Endangered). Current trends of population growth, land use/land cover change, and global climate change demand conservation and restoration actions to help revert their effects. The conventional conservation model consisting in the establishment of natural protected areas may be viable and still necessary in some areas to preserve the integrity of cloud forests as a whole. Nevertheless, novel restoration strategies are needed across most of its original range that are capable of reconciling the sustainable exploitation of these forests and the well-being of their inhabitants with the conservation of the extraordinary natural heritage that these forests signify for Mexico and the world. © 2012 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre.

Despite its importance and the enormous research effort devoted to it in the last decades, desertification is a topic surrounded by controversy and disagreement. This controversy is rooted in the traditional separation of the biophysical and socio-economic dimensions of desertification, which have been studied separately by scientists from both the natural and the social sciences. This separation has been fueled by the lack of a conceptual and synthethic framework suited to deal with both dimensions simultaneously. In this article we review the main topics surrounding desertification, introduce a new conceptual framework designed to study the biophysical and socio-economic dimensions of desertification simultaneously, review some of the measures being carried out to manage desertified lands and discuss some of the main challenges ahead in the research and management arenas. © 2005 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre.

The difference between ""strategic and national security service"" and ""commodity of national property"" is clarified. Econometric models are presented and estimated in order to explore the efficiency level of the drinking water pricing for household use and to clearly view how equitable is such service, assuming that efficiency refers to what actually is and equity to what is desirable. Based on information of the year 2000, the main conclusion that may be drawn is that prices for the service under study are not equitable nor efficient. Finally, a price system is proposed which considers efficiency -return of the production total costs (extraction, water treatment, storage, conduction, administration, etc.)- as well as equity: those who earn the most pay the highest rates (which is desirable).","Efficiency; Equity; Fee; Marginal cost; Price","Mexico [North America]; North America; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Estimation; Mathematical models; Potable water; Water supply; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Estimation; Mathematical models; Potable water; drinking water; economic analysis; water supply; Econometric models; Marginal cost; Mexico; Water supply","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-32544440757"

In this work the semi-physics enhanced RMMF model is applied into a GIS to elaborate spatially distributed maps of potential and effective cumulative runoff and soil erosion at the La Coloma Gully catchment (Spanish Central Pre-Pyrenees). The gully reaches a maximum length of 523 m and is divided into four different sectors according to its physiographic properties. The map of soil detachment by splash highlights the key role of vegetation properties to explain the different estimated rates. Processes of runoff accumulation and infiltration and slope values mainly control the estimated values of soil detachment by runoff. The average value of soil erosion at catchment scale is 33.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1 being runoff transport capacity the limiting factor in 88% of the surface and total soil loss adds up to 411.4 Mg yr-1. The average value of estimated soil erosion in the gully is 176.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 with values that range between 0.1 and 502.6 Mg ha-1 yr-1 for the different sectors and the total volume of runoff is 779 mm yr-1. Crops, paths and areas with low vegetation cover and high slope are the main source areas of sediment to the main channel of the gully and present high values of soil erosion (higher than 30 Mg ha-1 yr-1).

With high importance at the biological and socio-economic level, mangroves constitute one of the strategic marine ecosystems of Colombia. Along the Caribbean coast of Colombia, mangrove forests are established around marshes or coastal lagoons; most of them have scarce scientific information which describe these ecosystems at a qualitative level, but also which shows their biological processes and characteristics in a quantitative form. Given the importance of these ecosystems, the present work contributes to the direct and recent knowledge of the structure, distribution, abundance and regeneration capacity of the mangrove forest in Ciénaga de Cholón (Isla Barú, Bolívar province). Using surveys and in-situ observations, general height averages were calculated at 3.42 m, DAP at 4.94 cm and density of 21 trees 100 m-2, where seedlings was the dominant diametric category, followed by stem-wood; saplings constituted a smaller percentage. Mangrove species found were Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans, with average heights of 3.45 and 2.93 m, and DAP of 4.45 and 3.29 cm respectively. Rhizophora mangle was the dominant species, being found in all the stations, while A. germinans was found only in two of the stations sampled, coinciding with particular soil requirements for the settlement and development of each species. Regarding regeneration, a total of 117 R. mangle juvenile plants were evaluated in four stations, calculating a growth rate of 0.69 cm month-1 and a density average of 1.28 plants m-2. It is expected that the information obtained will allow for the evaluation of changes of this mangrove forest over time, contributing to guarantee the conservation and sustainable management of a valuable ecosystem and the National Natural Park Corales del Rosario y San Bernardo, where Cholón is located.","Ciénaga de Cholón; Density; Growth; Mangrove; Structure","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977855226"

The depth of the crisis in terms of falls in GDP per capita and increases in unemployment was due to the fact that the reversal of capital flows coincided with a real estate mortgage and banking crisis.

One means to mitigate population isolation is the protection of movement corridors among habitat patches. Nevertheless, the utility of small, narrow, linear features as habitat corridors has been hotly debated. Here, we argue that analysis of movement across continuously resistant landscapes allows a shift to a broader consideration of how landscape patterns influence connectivity at scales relevant to conservation. We further argue that this change in scale and definition of the connectivity problem improves one's ability to find solutions and may help resolve long-standing disputes regarding scale and definition of movement corridors and their importance to population connectivity. We used a new method that combines empirically derived landscape-resistance maps and least-cost path analysis between multiple source and destination locations to assess habitat isolation and identify corridors and barriers to organism movement. Specifically, we used a genetically based landscape resistance model for American black bears (Ursus americanus) to identify major movement corridors and barriers to population connectivity between Yellowstone National Park and the Canadian border. Even though western Montana and northern Idaho contain abundant public lands and the largest wilderness areas in the contiguous United States, moving from the Canadian border to Yellowstone Park along those paths indicated by modeled gene flow required bears to cross at least 6 potential barriers. Our methods are generic and can be applied to virtually any species for which reliable maps of landscape resistance can be developed. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Animal movement; Black bear; Connectivity; Corridor; Least-cost path; Ursus americanus; Yellowstone to Yukon","Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Maps as Topic; Models, Biological; United States; Ursidae; Canada; North America; United States; Yellowstone National Park; Animalia; Ursus americanus; bear; connectivity; conservation planning; economic analysis; empirical analysis; gene flow; habitat corridor; habitat use; movement; protected area; wilderness area; animal; article; audiovisual equipment; bear; biological model; demography; environmental protection; methodology; physiology; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-61849132323"

Under conditions of cultivation in soil or substrate, some cultivars develop visual symptoms of leaf scorch and tip burn in young leaves and problems of quality, such as flacidity of the stem and shorter vase life. These symptoms have been attributed to a deficiency of Ca, and indicate that the requirement for this nutrient may be different among cultivars. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of the supply of Ca in the development and nutrition of Asiatic Lilium cv. Dream Land and Vermeer, and to determine the demand of Ca of these cultivars. The treatments were the application of nutritive solutions with different levels of Ca determined according to the universal method of preparation of nutritive solutions (Steiner, 1984). The treatments had no effect (p>0.05) on the development and nutrition of Dream land. The requirement of average supply of Ca for this cultivar was 6.75 me L-1; while for cv. Vermeer the maximum development was obtained with 9.94 me L-1. The concentration of Ca associated with the maximum production of dry weight (51.6 g plant-1) at the moment of cutting for Dream land was 0.31% and 0.30% for Vermeer, with a biomass of 16.9 g plant-1. The requirements of Ca, as well as the supply, varied among cultivars.","Lilium Asiatico; Requirement and supply of calcium","Lilium","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-59549100014"

I argue that, from that point on, there was a reorganization of the State's presence in the industrial sector that tended to rationalize and privatize the state-owned companies. In the case of the DiNIE, this process was the result of the projects of the people in charge of economy policies, who wanted to reintegrate Argentina to the multilateral trade system. This decision involved having to deal with the negotiation of commercial debts and the ""enemy property"" problem, which hindered the economic relationship with West Germany. This article studies both the negotiations between the Argentine and the German government aiming to solve those problems and the first privatization of the companies, which started in June, 1958. The second section of the paper reconstructs the evolution of the DiNIE within the framework of the economic and industrial developmental policies. I argue that the DiNIE companies got trapped between the accumulation of public debt and the orthodox economic policy which restricted the investment flow for the public sector. It is regarding this subject that the orthodox ideas led Arturo Frondizi's government to favour the sale of companies as the only viable solution for the economic and financial deterioration. The paper analyzes the characteristics of the 1961 privatization, which culminated in the sale of a number of companies to their workers, and assesses its impact. On this matter, this article offers and example of the management of stateowned companies for that period and contributes to a better description of the nature of Frondizi's policies.","","Argentina; German Federal Republic; South America; debt; economic history; economic policy; economic relations; industrial development; industrial restructuring; negotiation process; privatization; state owned enterprise; trade","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33747803387"

The methodology used was based on innovation and social relationships networks. Midsize producers had an average yield of 5.75 t/ha-1, almost three times higher than what smallholders achieved, largely due to their rate of adoption of innovations (INAI), which was 48.22%, in contrast to 12.55% in the other group, and to their excellent trust relations (social capital). Furthermore, the midsize farmers' network is more comprehensive because it has higher density, size and number of links, and a smaller standard deviation. In addition, their centralization index is lower than in the small farmers' network, a fact related with unequal access to information and knowledge.","Adoption rate; Agricultural innovations - Michoacán (Mexico); Corn industry- case studies; Cultivation - economic aspects; Key players; Social capital; Technology; Transmission; Trust relationships; Zea maize; Zea mays","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864927976"

With an estimate of the ecosystem-service supply curve from a pilot auction, conservation planners can explore the financial, ecological, and socioeconomic consequences of alternative scaled-up programs. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in Indonesia, where soil erosion on coffee farms generates downstream ecological and economic costs. Bid data from a small-scale, uniform-price auction for soil-conservation contracts allowed estimates of the costs of a scaled-up program, the gain from integrating biophysical and economic data to target contracts, and the trade-offs between poverty alleviation and supply of ecosystem services.

The development of resistance is usually controlled by a number of procedures applied to the agricultural land to overcome or reduce the resistance of the pests to the control agents utilized. The form of evolution of the insect ́s resistance to the control agents is of considerable relevance and involves ecological, genetic and economic aspects. When Bt plants were developed and widely cultivated, research and studies in this field became more and more important and are now essential for the maintenance of productivity of these cultures. The management of the evolution of the resistance of the Bt plants is a question with many polemical aspects, from both practical and theoretical standpoints. The principal strategy applied to ""manage"" the evolution of the resistance of the Bt plants is known as ""high doses- structured refuge"". Also, it is of considerable importance that methods of monitoring the plant populations are implemented to detect the presence, or an increase in the numbers, of resistant insects. In this context the underlying biological principles that are employed to substantiate the management strategy adopted must be clearly understood and the principal uncertainties associated with generalized applications recognized. What would happen if the resistance was determined by recessive genes, or when the crossing of resistant and susceptible individuals does not happen in a random manner? One of the important points in the strategy of resistance management is to monitor the cultivated areas with the objective of detecting the presence of resistant insects. The efficiency of the monitoring methods depends on their capacity to detect the presence of the allele that confers resistance while the frequency is still very low (in general less than 0.001). Among these methods, bio-testing the response dose, diagnosis bio testing and the characterization of F2 are considered best. A clear understanding of all the aspects involved in managing and monitoring the evolution of the resistance is essential because our evolutionary relation with the insect pests can be compared to an armament race. Also, it becomes possible to understand why resistance management is considered one of the great problems linking ecology, evolution and economy at the present time.","Bt-crops; High doses; Monitoring; Resistance management; Structured refugee","Hexapoda","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959813895"

These include, for example, providing habitat or food resources to rare species, serving as functional substitutes for extinct taxa, and providing desirable ecosystem functions. We speculate that non-native species might contribute to achieving conservation goals in the future because they may be more likely than native species to persist and provide ecosystem services in areas where climate and land use are changing rapidly and because they may evolve into new and endemic taxa. The management of non-native species and their potential integration into conservation plans depends on how conservation goals are set in the future. A fraction of non-native species will continue to cause biological and economic damage, and substantial uncertainty surrounds the potential future effects of all non-native species.

The idea behind applying tradable permits to conservation is that developers wishing to turn land to economic purposes, thereby destroying valuable habitat, may only do so if they submit a permit to the conservation agency showing that habitat of at least the equivalent ecological value is restored elsewhere. The developer himself does not need to carry out the restoration, but may buy a permit from a third party, thus allowing a market to emerge. Nevertheless, the application of tradable permits to biodiversity conservation is a complex issue because destroyed and restored habitats are likely to differ. There may be various trade-offs between the ecological requirements that destroyed and restored habitats be as similar as possible, and the need for a certain level of market activity to have a functioning trading system. The success of tradable permits as an instrument for reconciling the conflicts between economic development and conservation depends on the existence of certain economic, institutional, and ecological preconditions, for example, a functioning institutional framework, sufficient expert knowledge, and adequate monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Conservation policy; Cost-effectiveness; Economic development; Habitat banking; land use; Market based instruments; Tradable permits","Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Ecosystem; Environment; Extinction, Biological; Licensure; Population Dynamics; anthropogenic effect; conceptual framework; conservation planning; cost-benefit analysis; economic development; environmental policy; habitat loss; habitat restoration; market system; species conservation; trade-environment relations; article; biodiversity; economic development; economics; ecosystem; environment; environmental protection; legal aspect; licensing; population dynamics; species extinction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954166499"

Soybean and its derivatives constitute presently most important Argentina's export and cash source. Here, we tested whether soybean's expansion has caused a detectable decrease in crop diversity. We specifically assessed changes in total cultivated area, identity and degree of dominance of the most important crop (i.e., the one accounting for the largest proportion of the total cultivated area), and crop diversity over the period 1961-2006. Argentina's total cultivated area increased by about 45% from 1990 to 2006 and it was associated with a replacement of wheat by soybean as the dominant crop. In 2006 soybean accounted for ∼50% of the total cultivated area in our country, the largest dominance reached by any crop during the last five decades. Different diversity indicators, including Shannon-Wiener's H', Pielou's J and Hurlbert's PIE indexes agreed that crop diversity has decreased >20% during the period of soybean dominance. In addition to the direct loss of biodiversity caused by deforestation for agriculture expansion, our results evidence a trend towards homogenization of Argentina's agriculture landscape with likely consequences for remnant biodiversity, degradation of different ecosystem services, and a more vulnerable production structure.","Crops; Dominance; Evenness; Soybean","Argentina; South America; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; arable land; biodiversity; cropping practice; cultivation; deforestation; diversity index; dominance; ecosystem service; population structure; socioeconomic impact; soybean; species evenness; wheat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67650694978"

In Spain, the usual scheme of housing intervention is far from those policies implemented by its European neighbours, possibly due to a different conceptualization regarding the responsibilities assumed by the welfare state. Spanish housing policy has tended to stimulate new construction with a double objective, to promote homeownership as a priority form of tenure and to stimulate the real estate sector as a catalyst for economic growth. This strategy has not happened in Europe where the concept of social housing, public and affordable, has become firmly established in the housing schemes.The aim of this article is two-folded: on the one hand, once the Spanish Wel-fare State is characterised and having identified the main tools of housing policy in Spain over the years, the paper aims to determine both negative and positive effects of the implementation of housing policy in the Spanish housing system.

In order to achieve this, dealing with the concept of sustainable forest management, different potential methodologies for forest planning and monitoring implemented in other European regions are reviewed, taking their potentiality into account as alternatives to advance and development of the Galician forestry sector. Therefore, given the current forestry problems, four key issues have been selected for their possible adaptation to Galicia: accountancy data network, co-operation models, education and advice programmes and public measures of economic support. These guidelines are analysed at three levels: description of the current experiences on the subject in Galicia, the basis for the possible application and adaptation of European models, later analysis of the main programmes and measures carried out in different European regions and finally, a proposal of criteria for their adaptation to the community.","Economic efficiency; Farm forestry; Forest innovation; Forest profitability","Eurasia; Europe; Galicia; Southern Europe; Spain; forest management; forestry policy; forestry practice; forestry production; land tenure; policy implementation; private land; profitability; sustainability; sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-54849427076"

The main effect of migration on the productive activities is the scarcity of workers which causes: intensification of work for the people who remain in the community, increased hiring of farmworkers and machinery, increased land leasing, lack of innovation of productive techniques, reduction of plant and animal biodiversity, and decrease or abandonment of farming activity. It is concluded that the migration impact on the communities is reflected on: 1) Farming activities deterioration due to scarcity of workers and natural and economic factors that reduce productive options; 2) cultural changes in migrants which move them away from rural life and farming activities.","Case study; Community of origin; Peasant agriculture; Rural migration","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-54949099787"

The incorporation of mountain regions into a wider and more dynamic socio-economic system implies the intensification of the best areas (the most fertile and accessible) and the under-use and even desertion of a great part of the territory. This itself implies a change from obtaining ""maximum' production from the land to seeking the greatest economical viability by work investment, which is the main aim of the exploitation system on the mountains under study. Along with this feature other features to be noted are the simplification and specialisation of the productive system, to satisfy external demand, which implies a poorer adaption to micro-environmental conditions and a greater vulnerability to the system as a whole. -English summary","","(West); Europe; environmental conditions; land management; mountainous area; productive system; socio-economic system; spatial disarticulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025584952"

Socioeconomic and political factors include the presence or absence of well‐defined resource tenure rights, physical and social infrastructure, markets, and alternative land uses. We conclude that although extractive reserves can play a significant role in preserving tropical forests as a part of a broader land‐use spectrum, their effectiveness is highly dependent on prevailing local ecological, socioeconomic, and political conditions.

This has been a subject of many debates. Several authors have argued that pampean landowners showed little interest in the development of manufacturing. It has been suggested that public policy was either indifferent or hostile to the expansion of industry. Another line of interpretation defies these statements, arguing that no contradiction existed between agrarian expansion and industrial growth. However, insufficient empirical evidence has been deployed to test these interpretations. Analysing how the Argentine landowners reacted to the emergence of a protectionist climate after the Barings Crisis, this paper aims to shed new light on this debate. I argue that neither the views that emphasise harmony between landowners and manufacturers nor those that stress conflict convey an accurate picture of their relationship. This paper shows that while there was no identification of interests between large landowners and industrialists, and therefore some ground for conflict in the 1890s, this was never translated into open hostility. By the turn of the century, changing historical circumstances affected the way in which landowners defined their interests and expectations with regards to industrial development and protectionist economic policy, and their initial fears gave way to a less hostile approach. In the end, the set of social and economic forces acting in turn of the century Argentina, and the constraints forced upon Argentine policy-makers resulted in a middle-ground approach to protectionism and the tariff issue, which was largely accepted by both rural entrepreneurs and manufacturers until the 1920s.","","Argentina; economic history; historical geography; land rights; protectionism; trade policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0842338108"

To that end, linear programming methods are formulated, emphasizing possible reductions on water availability of 18 and 24%. Land, water, labor and agriculture machinery are constraints in the model. Gross revenues minus production costs estimate net revenues. Model solutions use both 1999 product prices and those estimated for 2010. Net revenue, crop pattern and marginal revenue are reported. Marginal revenue is used as shadow price of irrigation water and, according to the results, varies from Mex $0.54-2.28/m3 for surface water and between Mex $0.66 and 6.85/m3 for groundwater. The shadow price of groundwater rises up to Mex $152/m3 for highly profitable crops.","Linear programming; Shadow prices; Water value","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34249306369"

The remaining forests, the 16th and 17th century chronicles, explorers' accounts and the results of contemporary researchers let us imagine how the vegetation could be. An analysis of the human use of rural areas by Andean societies in the valleys and highlands, from prehistory to our time serves as the basis of the interpretation of the causes of alarming deforestation. Population increase, pressure of livestock, the role of the mines, the construction of the railways and their influences on native vegetation, are discussed. The impact of chicha trade, land tenure and the numerous wars on the environmental degradation are also considered.

In 1970, efforts to establish the parks were met with indifference but a practical strategy for nature conservation and favorable opportunities led to success, including establishment of Poas Volcano, Cahuita, Santa Rosa and Tortuguero National Parks in 1970–1971. Since then we have concentrated on four main activities. (1) procuring funds and personnel; (2) obtaining national and international support; (3) developing conservation education programs; and (4) getting environmental legislation passed Today we continue to build the national park system. We are creating a system of national forests, encouraging commercial reforestation and management of private land, consolidating the national parks system, and continuing to raise funds. Because most tourism is based on the national parks, we are asking the tourism industry to do its fair share to support the parks and to encourage wise use and conservation. Many organizations use funds to maintain an international bureaucracy rather than supporting direct conservation in the field. We do not need more planning studies and documents to tell us what to do, but instead we need funds to make environmental conservation a reality at the grass‐roots level. International environmental standards should be set by a United Nations environmental organization that is empowered to infringe on the sovereignty of individual states in environmental matters. Future concerns for the national parks of Costa Rica include the economic situation, conservation education, the need to demonstrate the monetary value of conservation, population growth, the need for citizen involvement and the need for effective environmental legislation.

We study and provide examples of its functioning, showing the existence of negative incentives to investment. The agents' incentives within the system are studied, together with their opportunities for strategic behavior, and some simulations are performed which suggest that net social benefits from expansions are not fully reflected in the voting mechanism established for the Public Contest Regime. On the one hand, it is found that the open access principle, imposed by the legislation, gives room for opportunistic or strategic behavior. Provided that a contribution to the financing of an expansion does not grant property rights over it, agents may prefer to reject expansions that may be used by future competitors entering the industry. On the other hand, the rule for selecting voters and the voting rule itself -which is used to decide on a given project- do not imply that the selected option is the best one available. Some valuable investment opportunities may not be exploited because of the veto power of minority groups. Simulations are performed using a simple model of the electric system as shaped by the regulation, which allow to find examples of how the use of the Beneficiaries Method in the Public Contest Regime would lead to reject socially desirable investment. At the same time, it is shown that an alternative funding and voting scheme -consisting of distributing the burden of the project's cost according to the expected change in benefits from its completion- does not necessarily provide better incentives for undertaking socially desirable projects.","","Argentina; economic analysis; electricity supply; investment incentive","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031659141"

Among the basic notions that are cursorily presented, attention is drawn to the economic culture. A description of the characteristics of Soviet agricultural institutions (state-owned land, collective farms, state farms, individual plots and local authorities in rural areas) completes this analysis at the general level. These paradigms then serve to analyze the first two phases (stabilization and introduction of the market) in the neoclassical transition strategy as applied to farming in North Kazakhstan. In this area, the institutions inherited from the Soviet era continue to survive, sometimes under a slightly disguised form. They account for both the noncompletion of a real transition and the gradual decline in farming. In these conditions, the third phase (structural corrections) of the transition under the neoclassical paradigm cannot be envisioned.

Those changes are highly correlated with the overall process of modernisation affecting agriculture in Argentina, and particularly to vegetable production. Within an agrarian structure with a major proportion of family farms, processes of social differentiation, land and capital concentration, and the emergence of new social actors, began to take place. The analysis of the productive and economic organisation of two main types of vegetable producers enables study of those transformations. A majority of vegetable-producing family farms have experienced economic decay, and through a resistance strategy they try to maintain themselves in a sort of unstable equilibrium; a small number of vegetable modern units underwent capitalisation through an economic strategy of flexible growth. Vegetable sharecroppers (""medianero'), migrate from Bolivia, and provide almost all of the local labor supply, including the incorporation of this own family group. With this ""medianero', the social organisation of both types of vegetable farms is being transformed. -from English summary","","Argentina; Buenos Aires; Buenos Aires Province; agricultural modernisation; agricultural system; developing country; family farming; labour conditions; labour supply; rural area; socio-economic change; vegetable production","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028551267"

The correlation between the qualitative and quantitative diagnoses allowed the identification of sites where degradation by water erosion affected the sustainability of the system.

The analysis of these topics becomes even more urgent given the persistence and aggravation of economic inequality among different social sectors and geographic regions. However, scholarly works on 19th century Buenos Aires have largely neglected them. Works that examine the period have insisted on the existence of growing inequalities in the region due to unequal patterns of land distribution. Nonetheless, land distribution only constitutes one of the factors to be taken into consideration, and it is probably not even the best available indicator of the level of economic inequality. In this article we will approach the problem of wealth distribution in the Buenos Aires countryside through a previously unused source: the economic censuses carried out by governor Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1839. The purpose of these censuses was to gather the information needed for the imposition of an income tax: the Contribución Directa. After a thorough evaluation of the source and its reliability, the article discusses methodological issues. Finally, using indicators such as Lorenz curves or the Gini index, we reach some interesting conclusions on the levels of wealth inequality existing in the Buenos Aires countryside at that time, and its links with economic growth.","","Argentina; Buenos Aires [Federal District]; Federal District [Argentina]; South America; economic growth; income distribution; land market; nineteenth century; tax system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0442296471"

Persistent attacks by lions on humans hinder support among local peoples for lion conservation. We analyzed 193 attacks by lions on humans and conducted interviews with 73 villagers to identify the spatial, temporal, and social factors associated with lion‐human conflict in the region. An average of 14.8 attacks by lions and 2.2 lion‐caused deaths occurred annually between 1978 and 1991, and most attacks (82%) occurred on private lands outside the forest reserve. A drought in 1987–1988 precipitated an increase in rates of conflicts (from 7.3 to 40.0 attacks/year) and in the proportion of attacks that occurred outside the reserve (from 75% to 87%). The spatial pattern of lion attacks could not be distinguished from random before the drought, whereas attacks were clustered after the drought in village subdistricts with a higher ratio of revenue land to forest edge and those closer to sites where lions were formerly baited for tourist shows. Subadult lions were involved in conflicts in disproportion to their relative abundance. A majority of villagers interviewed expressed hostile attitudes toward lions owing to the threat of personal injury and economic hardship (mainly livestock damage) posed by lions. The escalation in lion‐human conflict following the drought probably resulted from a combination of increased aggressiveness in lions and a tendency for villagers to bring their surviving livestock into their dwellings. Dissatisfaction with the government’s compensation system for lion‐depredated livestock was reported widely. The current strategy for coping with problem lions—that is, returning them to areas in the Gir forest already saturated with lions—is inadequate, as indicated by the sharp increase in lion‐human conflict since 1988. Prohibiting lion baiting for tourist shows, consolidation of reserve boundaries, and implementation of a more equitable and simpler system for compensating villagers for livestock destroyed by lions could provide short‐term alleviation of lion‐human conflict in the region. Long‐term alleviation may entail reducing the lion population by relocating or culling lions. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Los persistentes ataques de leones a humanos obstaculizan el apoyo de la población local para la conservación de leones. Nosotros analizamos 193 ataques de leones a humanos y conducimos encuestas a 73 pobladores locales para identificar los factores espaciales, temporales y sociales asociados con los conflictos entre leones y humanos en la región. Un promedio de 14.8 ataques por leones y 2.2 muertes causadas por leones ocurrieron anualmente entre 1978–91, la mayoría de los ataques (82%) ocurrieron en tierras privadas fuera de la reserva del bosque. Una sequía en 1987–91 precipitó un incremento en la tasa de los conflictos (de 7.3 a 40.0 ataques/año) y en la proporción de ataques ocurridos fuera de la reserva (de 75% a 87%). El patrón espacial de ataque de los leones no pudo ser distinguido del aleatorio antes de la sequía, mientras que los ataques después de la sequía pudieron ser agrupados en sub‐distritos poblacionales con una relación tierras explotables: bordes de foresta más alta y aquellos más cercanos a sitios dónde los leones eran cebados para espectáculos turísticos. Los leones subadultos se vieron envueltos en conflictos en forma desproporcionada a su abundancia relativa. La mayoría de los pobladores encuestados expresaron su hostilidad hacia los leones debido al peligro de daños personales y pérdidas económicas (principalmente daños en el ganado) causados por los leones. La escalda de conflictos entre leones y humanos que siguió a la sequía, es probablemente el resultado de la combinación del incremento en la agresividad de los leones y la tendencia de los pobladores a llevar el ganado sobreviviente a sus moradas. Se reportó ampliamente una desatisfacción con respecto a la compensación que el gobierno brinda por la predación por leones del ganado. La presente estrategia para enfrentar los leones problemáticos, consistente en retornarlos a las áreas en el bosque de Gir que ya están saturadas con leones, es inadecuada, tal como lo indica el marcado incremento en el aumento de conflictos entre leones y humanos desde 1988. El prohibir que los leones sean cebados para los espectaculos turisticos, la consolidación de los límites de la reserva y la implementación de un sistema más equitativo y simple para compensar a los pobladores por el ganado perdido a causa de los leones puede mitigar en el corto plazo el conflicto entre leones y humanos en la región. Una mitigación a largo plazo podría implicar la reducción de la población de leones a través de la relocalización o eliminación de los leones menos aptos.","","India, Gujarat, Gir Forest; Panthera leo persica; Asiatic lion; lion-human conflict","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028177210"

It is not easy to produce vegetables due to the lack of potable water. In order to solve this problem, this paper introduces a household agricultural production system utilizing seawater, which is distilled by means of a shallow solar still. The still has a free surface of 10 m2 and can yield an average daily quantity of 51/m2 daily. Distilled water is employed to grow vegetables (basically radishes, pumpkins and tomatoes) in an experimental plot of land where a highly efficient irrigation is pursued. Hence, it is possible to obtain biomass production of about 1 kg of fresh product for every 19 to 200 liters of distilled water, depending on the crop, in also variable crop cycles, between 30 and 150 days of duration.

Such management varies in response to local economic and ecological conditions but invariably targets key nontimber forest resources destined for local markets, requires minimal input of labor and capital, and maintains a considerable stock of biotic resources. While restricted to a specific forest type, this form of land use is associated with relatively high population densities and, if supported by appropriate development policies, could provide an environmentally sound land‐use alternative for hundreds of thousands of rural inhabitants of Amazonia.

What drives the evolution is that greater functional differentiation enhances the productive potential, provided it is possible to sustain the corresponding patterns of cooperation. Historically, the development of monetary exchange had a central rote in allowing economic innovation to take place. However, a distinctive feature of the industrial economy is the division of labor within the firm. The complementarity of inputs (and, especially, of capital goods) rationalizes the appearance of the 'capitalist firm' and, at the same time, it gives rise to an indeterminacy in the distribution of the resulting joint rents. The division of labor, inside and among firms, results in increasing returns to scale, as a property of the entire network of cooperation. The future evolution of the forms of the division of labor is not easy to predict. However, significant changes are taking place, associated with the rapid pace of technical change.","","division of labour; industrial development; technological change","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-20544449629"

First, a given society appropriates water simply mirroring its geographical pattern; later on, necessities, industries and technology modify this pattern, and finally, water is moved to the places that require it. This process of water appropriation, modification and intervention is complimented accordingly to partial interests: those of the social sector which impose its will over the rest. It is not an easy task to discover what is behind this social recurrence, as water scarcity is used to explain either underdevelopment, misery or marginality. Using as an example the case of the arid plains of La Rioja Province, in western Argentina, it surfaces the ideological and mystifier character of such ""water scarcity', used as a ""natural' determinant of the area's poverty and backwardness. Water use history is reconstructed since the XIXth century, linked to land settlement, productive activities and national and international determinants. Particular attention is given to cattle breeding and forestry production and its relation with dry periods. Although the water factor is and has been important, it can be overcome with appropriate economic stimuli, using local water resources which have not been appropriated up to the moment or bringing them from distant areas. Droughts - historically usual in the area - are overcome when economic incentives exists, pulling the investment of technical solutions. -from English summary","","Argentina; La Rioja Province; Los Llanos; colonisation; social recurrence; territorial organisation; water appropriation; water resources; water use","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024893828"

In an attempt to familiarize concerned biologists with this issue, we present an overview of the proposed positive and negative effects that foreign debt has had on neotropical forest loss. From the literature, we identify three main hypotheses as to how the large external debts of developing Latin American countries may contribute to deforestation. We find that (1) countries have not increased exports of tropical timber and beef in response to rising debt; (2) external debts have contributed to economic stagnation and an associated increase in poverty in Latin America, which in turn has caused the degradation of marginal lands, but the role of debt in this process cannot be isolated from other important contributing factors; and (3) while debt payments have probably led to governmental budget cutbacks in environmental spending, historically spending in these areas has not been high. On the positive side, we found that (1) innovative debt‐for‐nature swaps have traded devalued debt for a commitment and funds to create and protect nature reserves; and (2) debt could be exchanged for forestry and agricultural sectoral reform, which would have very large positive effects on the conservation and management of forests.

A partir de la literatura sobre el tema, nosotros identificamos tres hopótesis principales sobre como las grandes deudas externas de los países en vias de dasarrollo de América Latina contribuirían a la deforestación.

Desde un punto de vista positivo, (1) el innovativo troque de deuda por naturaleza ha intercambiado deuda devaluada por un compromiso y fondos para crear y proteger reservas naturales y (2) la deuda puede ser intercambiada por una reforma en los sectores de bosques y agricultura, la cual puede tener un gran efecto positivo en la conservación manejo de los bosques.","","Latin America; debt; deforestation; developing region; economic stagnation; environmental impact; environmental policy; foreign debt; poverty","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027470339"

Till now, two types of studies have been made of the policy for fighting against economic violations of the law (misappropriation of socialist property, private business, speculation, corruption, etc.). The first type has focused on the nature, ideology and organization of this policy. The second type has concentrated on violations and violators; and several studies devoted to the ""shadow"", ""parallel"" or ""underground"" economy have emphasized the vitality and social diversity of economic criminality. But this twofold view has artificially separated political decision-making from economic practices. In this article, information is seen as a key factor: what did political leaders know about this socioeconomic phenomenon ? Thanks to now open archives, specifically those of the Communist Party Committee in the Sverdlovsk Region, new thought can be given to this question. These archives let us see how information rose from the local to the regional and from the regional to the federal levels. This information has to do with both the socially labelled phenomenon of economic criminality and the actions for cracking down on it. The archives consulted show that the hierarchy was relatively well informed about quantitative and qualitative changes in economic criminality but that, despite its relative determination, it was powerless against it. Law enforcement in the Soviet state was not a steam roller. The recurrent campaigns against different forms of economic criminality had varying effects. Their failure can be set down to the problem of carrying the hierarchy's orders out at the local level.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874928919"

The project analyzes changes in the socio-economic factors in the Puriscal region of Costa Rica that came about because of this economics crisis. Modifications of the spatial land use pattern as a result of this phenomenon are presented in the study. Presented are the spatial and temporal transformations that occurred due to a reduction in the total area planted in coffee.","","methodology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029419950"

Reconciliation of resource exploitation and conservation is essential because of changes in the lake environment caused by human activities. Important new initiatives to shape national environmental policies for the lake are taking place. Regional cooperation is required for major lakewide studies, especially in lake circulation and the prevention of pollution, and in adjustment of fisheries objectives to meet conservation as well as economic goals. Basic conservation aims proposed are (1) avoidance of gross changes in natural communities in the lake in general, and (2) retention of the fauna in some parts in an unexploited state, as in underwater parks. Early strategies suggested are the extension of four existing wildlife land parks further into the lake to form underwater parks, and reconnaissance of other potential park sites. Initial ecological and social surveys conducted from the four parks would provide baseline data for management. Underwater park boundaries should as far as possible be determined on an ecological basis to encompass entire local distributions of species populations. A case of alternative boundaries is examined for the Nsumbu Park. Other important planning considerations are the multi‐use of parks in addition to fundamental conservation, such as tourism, sport fishing, and specific traditional lake and land uses. Regional cooperation between parks will be important for tourism. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Los cambios ambientales causados por las actividades humanas hacen esencial una reconciliación entre la explotación y la conservación de los recursos.

Se requiere una cooperación regional para realizar estudios más amplios sobre el lago, especialmente sobre circulación del lago y prevención de la contaminación, y en el ajuste de los objetivos de las pesquerías para lograr metas tanto en conservación como en economía. Los objetivos básicos propuestos son (i) evitar grandes cambios en las comunidades naturales del lago en general y (ii) retención de la fauna en ciertas partes bajo un estado de no‐explotación, por ejemplo, en parques subacuáticos. Las estrategias sugeridas con anterioridad comprenden la extensión de cuatro parques de vida silvestre terrestres, hacia el lago para formar parques subacuáticos y el reconocimiento de otros sitios potenciales para parques. Estudios ecológicos y sociales preliminares, llevados a cabo en los cuatro parques proveeran datos básicos para manejo. Los límites de los parques subacuáticos deben ser determinados, en lo posible, de acuerdo a bases ecológicas para abarcar íntegramente las áreas de distribución local de las poblaciones. Un caso de límites alternativos es examinado para el Parque Nsumbu. Otra consideración importante en cuanto a planeamiento es el uso multiple de los parques además de la conservación para, por ejemplo, turismo, pesca deportiva, activadades tradicionales específicas del lago y uso de la tierra.

They also show how the Chiquitano people are nowadays facing serious problems to sustain their traditional way of life. The article describes how the Chiquitano people's loss of control over their space and the new economic forces sharpen the social differentiation between them and force them to migrate or enter the urban working classes. -from English summary","","(Southeast); Bolivia; Chiquitano; Chiquitano people; economic impact; indigenous people; indigenous population; land rights; land-use change; marginalisation; social change; social stratification; traditional society","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028684513"

Within them we must distinguish between those specialized exclusively in the agrarian sector (agrarian groups), and the economic groups, highly diversified (in the industrial, services, banking, etc., sectors). The first ones are the most important in terms of land ownership, the second ones the most important in terms of the average size of the real estates. The economic groups control their estates through a property chain in which some of their firms control the capital of the others. The agrarian groups use other forms of control. Some of them control their lands only by means of companies, and their assets are directly in hands of the members of one family. Because of the simplicity of this control strategy, it is possible to see very clearly the existence of an unified managenement, and the commercial and financial links between the companies belonging to the same group. In other cases, nummerically significant, one family owns the land not only through the societies controlled by it, but also through other forms of ownership. Both the agrarian and the economic groups are highly diversified within the agrarian production. The geographic localization of their properties shows that they combine the different stages of the cattle production with the different agricultural products.","","Argentina, Buenos Aires Province; agrarian structure; agricultural management; developing country; farm management; land ownership","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-20444413478"

Seventy percent of the western United States is grazed, including wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, national forests, and even some national parks. The ecological costs of this nearly ubiquitous form of land use can be dramatic. Examples of such costs include loss of biodiversity; lowering of population densities for a wide variety of taxa; disruption of ecosystem functions, including nutrient cycling and succession; change in community organization; and change in the physical characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Because livestock congregate in riparian ecosystems, which are among the biologically richest habitats in arid and semiarid regions, the ecological costs of grazing are magnified in these sites. Range science has traditionally been laden with economic assumptions favoring resource use. Conservation biologists are encouraged to contribute to the ongoing social and scientific dialogue on grazing issues. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.
